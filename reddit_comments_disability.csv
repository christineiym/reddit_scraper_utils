disability,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"I had pretty much the same choice 3 years ago (accepted the day that COVID hit NC! haha), except I was in-state ($10k/yr w/ assured enrollment to nutr+biostats v MIT >$60k, after appealing).A lot of people say that the school doesn't matter so much for undergrad as it does for grad school; I would restate this as:Your education (and what makes a school special) is what you make of it.There are a lot of school-based factors that can influence your experience, such as the availability of opportunities, the environment, the importance of perceived prestige in your field, etc. (For grad school, the presence of certain labs is certainly a factor.) But often times, it's up to you to find the opportunities, to make the most of them, to make the most of what you have. (Case in point: To conduct biological research in high school while enrolled in community college, since I did not have access to any research labs like my friends who were in NCSSM had access to, under the mentorship of my biology professor (and with the support of the biol/chem dept there) I researched in a chemistry closet smaller than my dorm room and helped start a research club to encourage mentorship, lol.)That being said, when I started at UNC I was dead set on going to medical school (and on biomedical engineering), so the strong health programs (and chance to save a lot) appealed to me. Had I known that I would want to pursue a PhD in computer science (a complete 180, thanks to our CS dept lol),  I might have bitten some of the cost for MIT's program (which I'm sure is greatly funded as a private school, and has a great variety of research!). However:I have known a couple people (in Yale undergrad and Brown) who found that they felt like a number, who had little contact with professors. I'm not sure if that is the case at MIT, but in my personal experience, I've found the UNC CS department to feel like family. It can be difficult at first when you're in the large intro classes (prevalent at any college), but what helped me find community was really just getting involved in the department and university as a whole. I've ULAed, volunteered in the building, been sent to a conference, attended research/career events, been caught by a couple instructors singing ""Into the West"" at 10pm on a Friday while aggressively shaking out a tablecloth after an event, moderated for the undergrad Discord, wandered around the building popping into grad students'/professors' offices at every floor to ask about algebraic complexity or for a ride to the funeral of our department founder, found a couple professors who became close mentors (for research and even life advice), had the chance to make meaningful friendships with fellow students/ULAs, collaborated with fellow students and had the chance to facilitate collaborations between departments / involving administrators for an accessible navigation app we're creating (I am a wheelchair user and am involved in disability advocacy on campus). Outside of the CS department, I've interned at SAS, coordinated things for the nutrition department, and more. There are so many research and other opportunities across the university that I don't have time to remotely explore all of them, and I'm really blessed to have met everyone that I have.It's these relationships (and on a lesser scale, opportunities) that allow me to say, three years later, that I do not regret coming here.Ultimately, it's your choice, though! I remember that what drew me to MIT after I was accepted was the humanness of the letter/info they sent out -- the rawness of the admissions blogs, the ""welcome home"" and ""love, MIT"" in the admitted students' letter/page. I remember (before coming to UNC) sobbing when I found out that they couldn't offer me any more aid, because everyone says that the hardest part is getting into a school, and the rest (financial aid, etc.) will figure itself out, but for me, finances were a deciding factor, because I knew I would go into significant debt if I went into MIT, and I didn't need that hanging over my head if I could also get a relatively good education at UNC.I also can't speak to their CS program or other programs; I'm sure they are wonderful, too. And I can't say that your experience will go one way or another at either university. But just wanted to share my story in case an additional perspective was helpful.Praying for you in your decision! and congratulations on your acceptance to both schools and on your scholarship!! :)",8 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/11vyufq/unc_oos_15kyr_vs_mit_full_cost/

disability,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey! I use a wheelchair and am involved in disability advocacy/research on the UNC campus. Addressing your questions to the best of my knowledge:No; ADA law requires program accessibility, not building accessibility, so certain campus buildings and classrooms that are inaccessible (especially due to the age of campus and some maintenance backlogs) have not been made so. Classes are generally moved to a different classroom, which is an imperfect process but has mostly worked. (I say mostly because there are other events scheduled besides classes which are sometimes accidentally scheduled in said buildings, and because inaccessibility looks different for different people and in different contexts. For instance, one classroom I was in (before my professors moved the class) only allowed me to sit in the back. Technically, I could access a seat, but I couldn't see the board over the monitor at the front due to my short height, I couldn't go down the steps to write on the board or ask questions, and my teacher and I had a hard time hearing each other sometimes).I don't know if this is a requirement, but since COVID, all large lecture courses I have been in have recorded lectures except for my latest CHEM course.

Everyone I have personally encountered has been very understanding of my disability, and people generally are very enthusiastic about helping, though they are sometimes limited by lack of funding or lack of knowledge on how to help. However, ableism and discrimination (as well as stigmatizing) can be defined in multiple ways. Does lack of access to a program event count as discrimination? Does someone's (understandable, due to their lack of knowledge about why extra time between classes is medically necessary for some and also the fact that the imperfect system could be argued to give some students an unfair advantage in registration) exasperation or seeming anger at allowing priority registration, count as ableism? What about the various (unintended) barriers of construction that have required disabled students to somehow hop over broken sidewalks and/or signage in an attempt to find a curb cut, which inevitably leads to a part of the street where cars are, in order to access a class or event?Not that I know of, but we have various centers, organizations, and professors/staff/students who conduct research related to disability.I'm currently working on a project regarding mapping campus physical accessibility.

I think before the pandemic, students were required to request the recordings but currently, they’re automatically uploaded for anyone in the class to watch.As a first year student, the closest I ever have class is 25 minutes apart but that isn’t every day (but also it’s one building so 25 minutes is generally plenty of time).Generally yes. I was able to get temporary accommodations for one semester because the person who was doing my mental health evaluation talked to someone at the school. But I’m going to have to provide documentation to continue receiving those accommodations.I got one in about a week. We have a person from our campus psychological services that only works with the law students, which is super convenient.There was a required training for incoming first year students and I’m pretty sure it included disability/neurodiversity but I don’t really remember. I have no clue what’s required on faculty/staff side.Other students are ableist sometimes but it’s definitely not a lot. Especially given how affirming of a community I’ve found at the law school, the few instances of ableism don’t stand out at all.Not to my knowledge.

As you, for whatever reason have not, the professor is fulfilling their obligations.You need to satisfy whatever disconnect remains between your physician and ARS.  From ARS's site:Documentation must substantiate the fact that the condition (disability or chronic medical condition) is present, limiting a major life activity or major bodily function with impacts upon functioning.https://ars.unc.edu/students/general-documentation-guidelines-plus-information-applicable-esa-accommodation-requestsIf your request does not satisfy that, it might be for a variety of reasons.  Is the diagnosis recent?  Is the documentation thorough?ARS utilizes flexibility and discretion in determining how recent documentation must be.  Changing conditions and/or changes in how a condition impacts the individual may warrant more recent documentation or periodically updated documentation.  Generally, sufficient documentation includes: detailed documentation from a medical provider or a psychological/psycho-educational evaluation including the below numbered items as a minimum:Same site.What's the specific feedback you've received from ARS as to why what you've already provided is not sufficient?

I don't doubt that this is the case, which is why I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. However, that is not enough for me to feel comfortable on campus.You didn't mention this, but I'm going to touch on the CDC halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic individuals with covid, as this factors into my decision to pursue remote learning and is the most recent example of why I do not trust CDC recommendations.Here's an article from experts questioning the policy. (If you need help getting around the paywall just google the first sentence of the article and that should work). https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/health/covid-isolation-period-omicron.html.Here's an article from workers condemning the policy. https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/new-covid-isolation-guidance-cdc-leaves-many-workers-feeling-disposable-ncna1286821.Public health messaging consistently dismisses the effect of the virus on disabled/vulnerable populations, leading those populations (and others) to distrust public health organizations.It's difficult to link a study here because the concerns of disabled people aren't often heard in academic research, but here's one that discusses the larger impact of covid on disabled people. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14461242.2020.1784020. More generally, public health messaging has continually pushed a narrative that ""the virus is most dangerous to elderly and vulnerable people, which is an acceptable sacrifice"" since the beginning of the pandemic. Here's an omicron specific article interviewing a disability activist. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/people-with-disability-completely-overlooked-as-omicron-surges/049d9f69-11a2-4832-aebb-a215902bfb7f.'Long covid' as a mass disabling eventThere is little research yet discussing how common 'long covid' is with Omicron, though experts say it is definitely still a risk even with milder omicron cases. This article talks about the risks of long covid, specifically among vaccinated populations. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03495-2 To be clear, these numbers are likely lower than the reality because in many cases, patients with long covid are being dismissed without a pcr test confirming their infection (and we all know [or maybe not, but we should] how inaccessible pcr tests are for a lot of people).I'm disabled (though not in a way that makes me more vulnerable for covid), and being part of the disability community is very important for me and has exposed me to a lot of the public health failings most affecting disabled/vulnerable people, and in general I don't trust public health organizations to look out for the best interests of my community.(CONTINUED)",20 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/rw4sak/anyone_striking_next_week/
disability,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey u/XiuhtecuhtliVazquez! I'm so sorry it took me so long to get back to you on this.Firstly, just wanted to say that it sounds like you are killing it, so keep up the good work! :) That's really cool that you are planning to get EMT certified and get an associates and pursue an MD-PhD. I know of several students who work as EMTs here and I think it's a great way to work in medicine before medical school :)As a disclaimer, I should probably note that I'm currently planning to work towards a masters or PhD in computer science after graduating from undergrad, then apply (or transfer? lol apparently this is not common at all, and even less common those in comp sci) to MD/MD-PhD/PhD programs. This delay in applying is mostly due to the fact that I've been working and researching pretty much entirely in comp sci for the past 1.5 to 2 years, so while my comp sci research and work has to do with disability, accessibility, and education, I have little pre-med volunteering and no shadowing to speak of. I'm planning to rectify that, but I may not be the best person to ask for advice in that regard.Addressing your questions:Although I went to community college full-time for two years before coming to UNC, I was a dual-enrolled student, meaning that I was technically enrolled in high school at the same time and finished my high school degree at the same time that I did my associates. Unfortunately, I think the assured enrollment program is only offered to freshmen at this time (I had the choice to apply as a freshman or transfer student and applied as a freshman so that I could still be eligible for those types of programs) :(Depending on when you transfer, you may or may not apply directly to the BSPH program at UNC, but I am not knowledgeable on that, so I would advise you to meet with an advisor at your community college who specializes in transfer planning. If you are at an NC community college, I'd also advise you to take a look at the transfer articulation pathways here (https://catalog.unc.edu/admissions/undergraduate/nccc-transfer-pathways/) to help with course planning. Just curious, which BSPH program(s) are you interested in?Another thing to keep in mind when transferring is that there is a 180 credit hour limit (that includes all transfer credit hours accumulated during or after high school) on getting a degree, so depending on how your status as a transfer student is interpreted, you may only be able to stay for 2-3 years after transferring. I think they are a little more lenient on timeline with longer/professional degrees, though, but again, I'd advise speaking to a transfer advisor and/or contacting UNC admissions.As for pre-med requirements, I hesitate to say one thing since I haven't applied to medical schools after all. From my personal research, it appears that attitudes on completing pre-med reqs in CC or not vary by medical school, so I'd begin to draw up a potential list of schools you might want to apply to and research their websites and/or call them. (I literally called UNC's School of Medicine in 2019 or 2020 to see their perspective on taking courses at CC; the person who responded said it was fine so long as I took higher level courses at UNC to demonstrate my mastery of the material.)Given that you are planning to get an associate degree, I'd personally say go ahead and (after doing your research on the attitudes of schools you might want to apply to) knock out at least some of the basic pre-med requirements so that your general education requirements can be more pertinent. For instance, at CC (Central Piedmont), I took:General Biology I and II. (II doesn't exist at UNC and transferred as BIOL 279 instead. I then took my 'higher-level biology' here in the form of Anatomy & Physiology (BIOL 252/L), past/current/future various NUTR courses, and (future) Molecular Biology and Genetics (BIOL 202).)General Chemistry I and II. (Upon coming here, I took CHEM 261 and 241H/245L, and am currently taking CHEM 262/L, 3-4 years after doing gen chem.  There've been pros and cons to having such large gaps in between my CHEM courses, lol. I'm planning to do nutritional biochem next semester but have received mixed messages on if I should do CHEM 430 also.)General Physics I and II (Calculus based, but transferred as PHYS 116/117).Intro to Psychology.Intro to Sociology.Developmental Psychology (this isn't a pre-med requirement by any means, but it seemed relevant to me since I'm considering being a pediatrician).A bunch of math courses (it was essentially my major at the time, lol).General education requirements -- fulfilled through NC CC/UNC transfer agreements.Feel free to reach back out via here or DM :) Hope this helps!",1 upvote,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/sjrzja/question_about_public_health_majors/
disability,/user/Ok-Jellyfish-3705/,UNC 2024,"Hey there, transfer who just got in!!Background: I'm an older, non-traditional transfer student from a community college. My highschool GPA was something like a 3.6? It wasn't great. I can't remember what it was exactly since it was 10 or so years ago but I got denied from UNC when I applied in high school.My community college GPA has been a 4.0 and I am going to be graduating with my associates soon.I did not submit scores.Even though the professor who wrote my letter of recommendation was not in my intended major, it was a difficult class very out of my comfort zone that I really enjoyed. My tips for letters of recommendation, I think it's important to make sure that you are a very active and engaged student in the professor's classes. Make sure that the professor you are asking for a letter of recommendation knows you by name and knows your capabilities.Another thing about my background (and I'm only writing this so that if anyone reads it, it could give them hope!) is that I have an incredibly rocky academic past. Almost a decade ago, I actually flunked out of a university and I have tried college a total of three separate times before I was able to do it successfully these last two years. At a certain point, I took three years off and worked, making sure to take the time to get therapy and help. At this last school where I have a 4.0, I asked for academic forgiveness from the first time that I had attended there, and have continued my path through there. In my essay I wrote about all of this and I made sure to explain to them in a very raw way as to what had contributed to me doing so poorly. In addition to this, I wrote about the steps that I took to get better and get my disability treated. I wanted to show them that I had progressed and that I was capable of achieving the big things I have always wanted to achieve. In my essay, I also spoke about why I wanted to major in what I have chosen and the impact that subject has had on my life.My ECs were that I was in PTK and had a work study position in the field that I want to go into.So my biggest tip is to be you. Be vulnerable, flawed, and willing to be open about not just stuff you've been through but the active steps you've taken to overcome it. I think it's really good to be open about the mistakes you've made. I think that they want to see you as the complex human that you truly are. I don't necessarily think that Carolina wants the perfect student, because I definitely am not. It makes me cry even thinking about this but I guess they saw something in me that they believed in, and I am eternally grateful for that.If you look at other threads on here about transfer students who got in, I think many of us share the same trends in our essays. There's another very kind user on here who I saw mention on another thread that she spoke about her sobriety, [edit: oh! She posted in this thread! She can give a much better run down about her experiences then :)] while another user spoke about their difficulty with being a LGBTQ homeschooled kid. I think that Carolina wants to see you as a human and not just a ""grades machine"" first and foremost :)What is your story? What sets you apart from other people with top grades? What is going to drive you to accomplish the things you want? I think these are all important things to consider when applying. Good luck!!!

disabled,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"I had pretty much the same choice 3 years ago (accepted the day that COVID hit NC! haha), except I was in-state ($10k/yr w/ assured enrollment to nutr+biostats v MIT >$60k, after appealing).A lot of people say that the school doesn't matter so much for undergrad as it does for grad school; I would restate this as:Your education (and what makes a school special) is what you make of it.There are a lot of school-based factors that can influence your experience, such as the availability of opportunities, the environment, the importance of perceived prestige in your field, etc. (For grad school, the presence of certain labs is certainly a factor.) But often times, it's up to you to find the opportunities, to make the most of them, to make the most of what you have. (Case in point: To conduct biological research in high school while enrolled in community college, since I did not have access to any research labs like my friends who were in NCSSM had access to, under the mentorship of my biology professor (and with the support of the biol/chem dept there) I researched in a chemistry closet smaller than my dorm room and helped start a research club to encourage mentorship, lol.)That being said, when I started at UNC I was dead set on going to medical school (and on biomedical engineering), so the strong health programs (and chance to save a lot) appealed to me. Had I known that I would want to pursue a PhD in computer science (a complete 180, thanks to our CS dept lol),  I might have bitten some of the cost for MIT's program (which I'm sure is greatly funded as a private school, and has a great variety of research!). However:I have known a couple people (in Yale undergrad and Brown) who found that they felt like a number, who had little contact with professors. I'm not sure if that is the case at MIT, but in my personal experience, I've found the UNC CS department to feel like family. It can be difficult at first when you're in the large intro classes (prevalent at any college), but what helped me find community was really just getting involved in the department and university as a whole. I've ULAed, volunteered in the building, been sent to a conference, attended research/career events, been caught by a couple instructors singing ""Into the West"" at 10pm on a Friday while aggressively shaking out a tablecloth after an event, moderated for the undergrad Discord, wandered around the building popping into grad students'/professors' offices at every floor to ask about algebraic complexity or for a ride to the funeral of our department founder, found a couple professors who became close mentors (for research and even life advice), had the chance to make meaningful friendships with fellow students/ULAs, collaborated with fellow students and had the chance to facilitate collaborations between departments / involving administrators for an accessible navigation app we're creating (I am a wheelchair user and am involved in disability advocacy on campus). Outside of the CS department, I've interned at SAS, coordinated things for the nutrition department, and more. There are so many research and other opportunities across the university that I don't have time to remotely explore all of them, and I'm really blessed to have met everyone that I have.It's these relationships (and on a lesser scale, opportunities) that allow me to say, three years later, that I do not regret coming here.Ultimately, it's your choice, though! I remember that what drew me to MIT after I was accepted was the humanness of the letter/info they sent out -- the rawness of the admissions blogs, the ""welcome home"" and ""love, MIT"" in the admitted students' letter/page. I remember (before coming to UNC) sobbing when I found out that they couldn't offer me any more aid, because everyone says that the hardest part is getting into a school, and the rest (financial aid, etc.) will figure itself out, but for me, finances were a deciding factor, because I knew I would go into significant debt if I went into MIT, and I didn't need that hanging over my head if I could also get a relatively good education at UNC.I also can't speak to their CS program or other programs; I'm sure they are wonderful, too. And I can't say that your experience will go one way or another at either university.

Before classes began, a collective of frontline workers, undergrads, and grad students released a petition urging the university to reconsider opening up.Consistently ignoring students and faculty concerns about covid safety guidelinesStudent groups, grad students, and faculty concerns about covid safety guidelines have been largely ignored. The people in charge of decision making have shown disregard for student welfare in many other areas as well. I can't really link to articles or anything about this because it's mostly just student org reporting on social media and general sentiment, but regardless of whether you believe what I say on it or not, this is just one factor of many.

Students are returning from winter break all over the world, and those first few weeks of in person classes are going to throw everyone together.I was in person for Fall 2021 classes, and none of my classes adhered to the 'six feet apart' guidance. As people have become even more relaxed, i seriously doubt that classes will suddenly start following those rules.Attendance policies are very strict. There was no university-wide loosening of attendance policies in Fall 2021, with none announced for Spring 2022 either. Students who test positive will be returning to classes as soon as possible, students who have been exposed but haven't tested positive won't have excused absences, students who have the unidentified respiratory illnesses and haven't gotten tested won't have excused absences beyond the usual 'take 2-3 absences a semester without it affecting your grades.'Fake vaccine cards were common last semester, and there's no reason to assume fake PCR tests (that are required for unvaccinated people and campus residents to return) won't be common as well.I don't trust the student body to take appropriate precautions. People I know on campus have done incredibly irresponsible things ( going to class after they've been exposed without getting tested, going to class with the flu, etc).Most importantly, there are several personal health reasons why I do not feel comfortable placing myself at risk of even a 'mild' infection at this time. I am not immunocompromised, but I have several other concerns, including long covid, because I'm already disabled and have no desire to add another condition to my list of difficultes. I believe I (and many others with similar concerns) should still be able to access remote education. I took the time to compile this list, but I don't think anyone should have to justify a reluctance to return to campus under the circumstances. There's so much more I could write, but at this point I think I've at least proven that I have given this serious thought.(COMPLETE) (edit to fix formatting)",17 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/rw4sak/anyone_striking_next_week/

I don't doubt that this is the case, which is why I'm fully vaccinated and boosted. However, that is not enough for me to feel comfortable on campus.You didn't mention this, but I'm going to touch on the CDC halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic individuals with covid, as this factors into my decision to pursue remote learning and is the most recent example of why I do not trust CDC recommendations.Here's an article from experts questioning the policy. (If you need help getting around the paywall just google the first sentence of the article and that should work). https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/28/health/covid-isolation-period-omicron.html.Here's an article from workers condemning the policy. https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/new-covid-isolation-guidance-cdc-leaves-many-workers-feeling-disposable-ncna1286821.Public health messaging consistently dismisses the effect of the virus on disabled/vulnerable populations, leading those populations (and others) to distrust public health organizations.It's difficult to link a study here because the concerns of disabled people aren't often heard in academic research, but here's one that discusses the larger impact of covid on disabled people. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14461242.2020.1784020. More generally, public health messaging has continually pushed a narrative that ""the virus is most dangerous to elderly and vulnerable people, which is an acceptable sacrifice"" since the beginning of the pandemic. Here's an omicron specific article interviewing a disability activist. https://www.sbs.com.au/news/people-with-disability-completely-overlooked-as-omicron-surges/049d9f69-11a2-4832-aebb-a215902bfb7f.'Long covid' as a mass disabling eventThere is little research yet discussing how common 'long covid' is with Omicron, though experts say it is definitely still a risk even with milder omicron cases. This article talks about the risks of long covid, specifically among vaccinated populations. https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03495-2 To be clear, these numbers are likely lower than the reality because in many cases, patients with long covid are being dismissed without a pcr test confirming their infection (and we all know [or maybe not, but we should] how inaccessible pcr tests are for a lot of people).I'm disabled (though not in a way that makes me more vulnerable for covid), and being part of the disability community is very important for me and has exposed me to a lot of the public health failings most affecting disabled/vulnerable people, and in general I don't trust public health organizations to look out for the best interests of my community.(CONTINUED)",20 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/rw4sak/anyone_striking_next_week/

ars,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey! I use a wheelchair and am involved in disability advocacy/research on the UNC campus. Addressing your questions to the best of my knowledge:No; ADA law requires program accessibility, not building accessibility, so certain campus buildings and classrooms that are inaccessible (especially due to the age of campus and some maintenance backlogs) have not been made so. Classes are generally moved to a different classroom, which is an imperfect process but has mostly worked. (I say mostly because there are other events scheduled besides classes which are sometimes accidentally scheduled in said buildings, and because inaccessibility looks different for different people and in different contexts. For instance, one classroom I was in (before my professors moved the class) only allowed me to sit in the back. Technically, I could access a seat, but I couldn't see the board over the monitor at the front due to my short height, I couldn't go down the steps to write on the board or ask questions, and my teacher and I had a hard time hearing each other sometimes).I don't know if this is a requirement, but since COVID, all large lecture courses I have been in have recorded lectures except for my latest CHEM course. Depending on the class, some professors may ask for proof of accommodations before releasing a recording to you to encourage in-class attendance.15 minutes. If you have accommodations filed officially (i.e. with ARS (Accessibility Resources & Service)), you might be able to register ahead of others so that you can schedule classes farther apart for medical needs.

When neither of those things go to plan, people often feel like they’re failing college socially and academically.

ars,/user/KnowledgeStill5623/,UNC 2024,"I went through this process about a month ago, you should definitely visit CAPS - the good thing is you can get ARS accommodations without a full evaluation (which is super expensive, around 3-5K I believe).If you want to try out medications, I’d look around the local area for psychiatrist offices. UNC Health won’t prescribe most ADHD medications without the full evaluation, but private offices can (you have to ask first, though, some don’t). CAPS can give you a list of psychiatrists in Chapel Hill that will prescribe medications that way, but I ended up at a place not on the list because most of them didn’t take insurance. But even without insurance the price of a visit at those places was around $300, which is expensive but a lot cheaper than any full evaluation.",3 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/yef1az/recommendations_on_where_to_get_mental_health/

accommodations,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey! I use a wheelchair and am involved in disability advocacy/research on the UNC campus. Addressing your questions to the best of my knowledge:No; ADA law requires program accessibility, not building accessibility, so certain campus buildings and classrooms that are inaccessible (especially due to the age of campus and some maintenance backlogs) have not been made so. Classes are generally moved to a different classroom, which is an imperfect process but has mostly worked. (I say mostly because there are other events scheduled besides classes which are sometimes accidentally scheduled in said buildings, and because inaccessibility looks different for different people and in different contexts. For instance, one classroom I was in (before my professors moved the class) only allowed me to sit in the back. Technically, I could access a seat, but I couldn't see the board over the monitor at the front due to my short height, I couldn't go down the steps to write on the board or ask questions, and my teacher and I had a hard time hearing each other sometimes).I don't know if this is a requirement, but since COVID, all large lecture courses I have been in have recorded lectures except for my latest CHEM course. Depending on the class, some professors may ask for proof of accommodations before releasing a recording to you to encourage in-class attendance.15 minutes. If you have accommodations filed officially (i.e. with ARS (Accessibility Resources & Service)), you might be able to register ahead of others so that you can schedule classes farther apart for medical needs.

Everyone I have personally encountered has been very understanding of my disability, and people generally are very enthusiastic about helping, though they are sometimes limited by lack of funding or lack of knowledge on how to help. However, ableism and discrimination (as well as stigmatizing) can be defined in multiple ways. Does lack of access to a program event count as discrimination? Does someone's (understandable, due to their lack of knowledge about why extra time between classes is medically necessary for some and also the fact that the imperfect system could be argued to give some students an unfair advantage in registration) exasperation or seeming anger at allowing priority registration, count as ableism? What about the various (unintended) barriers of construction that have required disabled students to somehow hop over broken sidewalks and/or signage in an attempt to find a curb cut, which inevitably leads to a part of the street where cars are, in order to access a class or event?Not that I know of, but we have various centers, organizations, and professors/staff/students who conduct research related to disability.I'm currently working on a project regarding mapping campus physical accessibility.

So caveat, I used to be premed growing up until last year (and have pretty much all the recommended courses but not the clinical hours) but now am planning to apply to CS PhD programs this fall (specializing in accessibility, which has been my research focus for the past couple of years, and/or computational biology, which relates more to my nutrition second major and previous premed studies). I do know of more than one person who has done or is doing CS + premed, though!Workload: manageable in terms of credit hours, but full of STEM classes! I did do early college and got an associate's degree (including math + some social sciences + intro STEM classes -- there's a whole discussion that could be had on what to do about different medical schools' view on courses) before coming here which helped in terms of course planning, although I then added the nutrition BSPH which added to what I needed to do. (Note: when doing all STEM classes and getting clinical/volunteer experience (or significant work experience), I would not recommend going over a full load. Especially in your first semester, please take time to adjust, breathe, and explore.)Pre-med at UNC: https://hpa.unc.edu/explore/explore-health-careers/medicine/CS at UNC: https://cs.unc.edu/undergraduate/Premed opportunities / research: UNC has really, really strong health programs and is a research school. It can be hard to get clinical and other opportunities as a freshman, but in general, I'd say there are many medical-related research opportunities available in many fields (chemistry, cs, public health...).For CS research specifically, UNC CS has a very strong history in graphics, so we have multiple labs devoted to brain / colon / anatomical imaging. One of our professors, Dr. Natalie Stanley, also runs a computational immunology lab, and there is a computational medicine program that not many undergrads seem to hear about but that includes many labs across  many departments.Internships: For pre-meds, especially in the age of COVID, most people I know who are pre-meds (in CS or not) get certified to have a job at the hospital. That being said, there are a variety of things one can get involved in depending on what experience or internship you might be looking for. Would you consider CS industry internships / REUs, especially those that are health related? There are various health companies that hire CS interns. (Funnily enough, because I ended up working in the education division of SAS for 1.5 years, I can't speak to those, but I think many of my non-premed CS majors can!)Hope this helps!

I'm so sorry it took me so long to get back to you on this.Firstly, just wanted to say that it sounds like you are killing it, so keep up the good work! :) That's really cool that you are planning to get EMT certified and get an associates and pursue an MD-PhD. I know of several students who work as EMTs here and I think it's a great way to work in medicine before medical school :)As a disclaimer, I should probably note that I'm currently planning to work towards a masters or PhD in computer science after graduating from undergrad, then apply (or transfer? lol apparently this is not common at all, and even less common those in comp sci) to MD/MD-PhD/PhD programs. This delay in applying is mostly due to the fact that I've been working and researching pretty much entirely in comp sci for the past 1.5 to 2 years, so while my comp sci research and work has to do with disability, accessibility, and education, I have little pre-med volunteering and no shadowing to speak of. I'm planning to rectify that, but I may not be the best person to ask for advice in that regard.Addressing your questions:Although I went to community college full-time for two years before coming to UNC, I was a dual-enrolled student, meaning that I was technically enrolled in high school at the same time and finished my high school degree at the same time that I did my associates. Unfortunately, I think the assured enrollment program is only offered to freshmen at this time (I had the choice to apply as a freshman or transfer student and applied as a freshman so that I could still be eligible for those types of programs) :(Depending on when you transfer, you may or may not apply directly to the BSPH program at UNC, but I am not knowledgeable on that, so I would advise you to meet with an advisor at your community college who specializes in transfer planning. If you are at an NC community college, I'd also advise you to take a look at the transfer articulation pathways here (https://catalog.unc.edu/admissions/undergraduate/nccc-transfer-pathways/) to help with course planning. Just curious, which BSPH program(s) are you interested in?Another thing to keep in mind when transferring is that there is a 180 credit hour limit (that includes all transfer credit hours accumulated during or after high school) on getting a degree, so depending on how your status as a transfer student is interpreted, you may only be able to stay for 2-3 years after transferring. I think they are a little more lenient on timeline with longer/professional degrees, though, but again, I'd advise speaking to a transfer advisor and/or contacting UNC admissions.As for pre-med requirements, I hesitate to say one thing since I haven't applied to medical schools after all. From my personal research, it appears that attitudes on completing pre-med reqs in CC or not vary by medical school, so I'd begin to draw up a potential list of schools you might want to apply to and research their websites and/or call them. (I literally called UNC's School of Medicine in 2019 or 2020 to see their perspective on taking courses at CC; the person who responded said it was fine so long as I took higher level courses at UNC to demonstrate my mastery of the material.)Given that you are planning to get an associate degree, I'd personally say go ahead and (after doing your research on the attitudes of schools you might want to apply to) knock out at least some of the basic pre-med requirements so that your general education requirements can be more pertinent. For instance, at CC (Central Piedmont), I took:General Biology I and II. (II doesn't exist at UNC and transferred as BIOL 279 instead. I then took my 'higher-level biology' here in the form of Anatomy & Physiology (BIOL 252/L), past/current/future various NUTR courses, and (future) Molecular Biology and Genetics (BIOL 202).)General Chemistry I and II. (Upon coming here, I took CHEM 261 and 241H/245L, and am currently taking CHEM 262/L, 3-4 years after doing gen chem.  There've been pros and cons to having such large gaps in between my CHEM courses, lol. I'm planning to do nutritional biochem next semester but have received mixed messages on if I should do CHEM 430 also.)General Physics I and II (Calculus based, but transferred as PHYS 116/117).Intro to Psychology.Intro to Sociology.Developmental Psychology (this isn't a pre-med requirement by any means, but it seemed relevant to me since I'm considering being a pediatrician).A bunch of math courses (it was essentially my major at the time, lol).General education requirements -- fulfilled through NC CC/UNC transfer agreements.Feel free to reach back out via here or DM :) Hope this helps!",1 upvote,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/sjrzja/question_about_public_health_majors/

accessible,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"I had pretty much the same choice 3 years ago (accepted the day that COVID hit NC! haha), except I was in-state ($10k/yr w/ assured enrollment to nutr+biostats v MIT >$60k, after appealing).A lot of people say that the school doesn't matter so much for undergrad as it does for grad school; I would restate this as:Your education (and what makes a school special) is what you make of it.There are a lot of school-based factors that can influence your experience, such as the availability of opportunities, the environment, the importance of perceived prestige in your field, etc. (For grad school, the presence of certain labs is certainly a factor.) But often times, it's up to you to find the opportunities, to make the most of them, to make the most of what you have. (Case in point: To conduct biological research in high school while enrolled in community college, since I did not have access to any research labs like my friends who were in NCSSM had access to, under the mentorship of my biology professor (and with the support of the biol/chem dept there) I researched in a chemistry closet smaller than my dorm room and helped start a research club to encourage mentorship, lol.)That being said, when I started at UNC I was dead set on going to medical school (and on biomedical engineering), so the strong health programs (and chance to save a lot) appealed to me. Had I known that I would want to pursue a PhD in computer science (a complete 180, thanks to our CS dept lol),  I might have bitten some of the cost for MIT's program (which I'm sure is greatly funded as a private school, and has a great variety of research!). However:I have known a couple people (in Yale undergrad and Brown) who found that they felt like a number, who had little contact with professors. I'm not sure if that is the case at MIT, but in my personal experience, I've found the UNC CS department to feel like family. It can be difficult at first when you're in the large intro classes (prevalent at any college), but what helped me find community was really just getting involved in the department and university as a whole. I've ULAed, volunteered in the building, been sent to a conference, attended research/career events, been caught by a couple instructors singing ""Into the West"" at 10pm on a Friday while aggressively shaking out a tablecloth after an event, moderated for the undergrad Discord, wandered around the building popping into grad students'/professors' offices at every floor to ask about algebraic complexity or for a ride to the funeral of our department founder, found a couple professors who became close mentors (for research and even life advice), had the chance to make meaningful friendships with fellow students/ULAs, collaborated with fellow students and had the chance to facilitate collaborations between departments / involving administrators for an accessible navigation app we're creating (I am a wheelchair user and am involved in disability advocacy on campus). Outside of the CS department, I've interned at SAS, coordinated things for the nutrition department, and more. There are so many research and other opportunities across the university that I don't have time to remotely explore all of them, and I'm really blessed to have met everyone that I have.It's these relationships (and on a lesser scale, opportunities) that allow me to say, three years later, that I do not regret coming here.Ultimately, it's your choice, though! I remember that what drew me to MIT after I was accepted was the humanness of the letter/info they sent out -- the rawness of the admissions blogs, the ""welcome home"" and ""love, MIT"" in the admitted students' letter/page. I remember (before coming to UNC) sobbing when I found out that they couldn't offer me any more aid, because everyone says that the hardest part is getting into a school, and the rest (financial aid, etc.) will figure itself out, but for me, finances were a deciding factor, because I knew I would go into significant debt if I went into MIT, and I didn't need that hanging over my head if I could also get a relatively good education at UNC.I also can't speak to their CS program or other programs; I'm sure they are wonderful, too. And I can't say that your experience will go one way or another at either university.

accessible,/user/Vivid-Possibility321/,Former Student,"Former Econ major here. One of the great things about Econ (haven't seen the State curriculum, but Im guessing it applies as well) is that you can bundle it pretty easily with another major. What I liked about UNC is that it allowed me to mix and match courses from other fields of study that were a great complement to Econ: I took plenty of Poli Sci, History and Business courses (not sure it still applies, but you can take some KF classes as an Econ major...I took marketing).I knew I wanted a MBA later on; I felt that economics gave me a solid social science perspective with a dose of quantitative rigor. UNC places pretty well among Top 20 b-schools (this is one of the instances where prestige comes into play) and that bundle is very attractive to employers. I found the Econ Dept profs to be pretty accessible, particularly as you get into the higher level courses. There was only one prof I regret taking a class with, but I think its now easier to avoid bad profs.All big public universities will treat you like a number for the most part. The trick is getting into a smaller cell: the business school, the Econ depo, the nursing school, etc. There the experience becomes a lot less impersonal.I chose UNC because of the academic quality (teaching and prestige), the campus vibe (loved the college town atmosphere), the weather, and the all around-college experience (balance between academics and social). I had friends and relatives who went to NCSU who enjoyed their time there: our basic conclusion was that if you wanted engineering, State was the place but for social sciences and business, UNC was far better.

I'm a transfer student who came in with all my gen eds and just need major classes now, which are the hardest to get. I feel pretty hung out to dry by advising, as their usual advice is to keep trying and if I don't get what I want take the class in a different semester.

inaccessibility,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey! I use a wheelchair and am involved in disability advocacy/research on the UNC campus. Addressing your questions to the best of my knowledge:No; ADA law requires program accessibility, not building accessibility, so certain campus buildings and classrooms that are inaccessible (especially due to the age of campus and some maintenance backlogs) have not been made so. Classes are generally moved to a different classroom, which is an imperfect process but has mostly worked. (I say mostly because there are other events scheduled besides classes which are sometimes accidentally scheduled in said buildings, and because inaccessibility looks different for different people and in different contexts. For instance, one classroom I was in (before my professors moved the class) only allowed me to sit in the back. Technically, I could access a seat, but I couldn't see the board over the monitor at the front due to my short height, I couldn't go down the steps to write on the board or ask questions, and my teacher and I had a hard time hearing each other sometimes).I don't know if this is a requirement, but since COVID, all large lecture courses I have been in have recorded lectures except for my latest CHEM course. Depending on the class, some professors may ask for proof of accommodations before releasing a recording to you to encourage in-class attendance.15 minutes. If you have accommodations filed officially (i.e. with ARS (Accessibility Resources & Service)), you might be able to register ahead of others so that you can schedule classes farther apart for medical needs. While this is limited by class availability, it's worked well for me.Yes; the form is here: https://ars.unc.edu/students/request-forms/connect-arsNot sure, but generally you can walk in and be seen for an initial consult in an hour.Not sure for faculty/staff. For students (including undergraduate TAs), DEI training is generally limited to freshman orientation, which I unfortunately can't remember at this point.This is a very complex question. Everyone I have personally encountered has been very understanding of my disability, and people generally are very enthusiastic about helping, though they are sometimes limited by lack of funding or lack of knowledge on how to help. However, ableism and discrimination (as well as stigmatizing) can be defined in multiple ways. Does lack of access to a program event count as discrimination? Does someone's (understandable, due to their lack of knowledge about why extra time between classes is medically necessary for some and also the fact that the imperfect system could be argued to give some students an unfair advantage in registration) exasperation or seeming anger at allowing priority registration, count as ableism? What about the various (unintended) barriers of construction that have required disabled students to somehow hop over broken sidewalks and/or signage in an attempt to find a curb cut, which inevitably leads to a part of the street where cars are, in order to access a class or event?Not that I know of, but we have various centers, organizations, and professors/staff/students who conduct research related to disability.I'm currently working on a project regarding mapping campus physical accessibility.

These classes try to squeeze too much material in a short amount of time. These classes usually are massive, making interactions with faculty harder and inaccessible. If students don't pass these weeder classes, this will mess up their entire college life, and possibly jeopardize their life plans. The anxiety definitely drives people insane.Then, there come other problems that further fuels stress, such as registration, financial problems (considering CH is extremely expensive), and so much more.This really boils down to how broken the UNC system is. Just adding peer tutoring, ULA, and sending out meaningless emails seems like a cheap way to ""pretend"" that the administration ""cares"" about its student. The whole structure of the school needs to change in order to make a meaningful change.On a side note, please take care of international students.

inaccessible,/user/ChristineMendoza/,UNC 2024,"Hey! I use a wheelchair and am involved in disability advocacy/research on the UNC campus. Addressing your questions to the best of my knowledge:No; ADA law requires program accessibility, not building accessibility, so certain campus buildings and classrooms that are inaccessible (especially due to the age of campus and some maintenance backlogs) have not been made so. Classes are generally moved to a different classroom, which is an imperfect process but has mostly worked. (I say mostly because there are other events scheduled besides classes which are sometimes accidentally scheduled in said buildings, and because inaccessibility looks different for different people and in different contexts. For instance, one classroom I was in (before my professors moved the class) only allowed me to sit in the back. Technically, I could access a seat, but I couldn't see the board over the monitor at the front due to my short height, I couldn't go down the steps to write on the board or ask questions, and my teacher and I had a hard time hearing each other sometimes).I don't know if this is a requirement, but since COVID, all large lecture courses I have been in have recorded lectures except for my latest CHEM course. Depending on the class, some professors may ask for proof of accommodations before releasing a recording to you to encourage in-class attendance.15 minutes. If you have accommodations filed officially (i.e. with ARS (Accessibility Resources & Service)), you might be able to register ahead of others so that you can schedule classes farther apart for medical needs. While this is limited by class availability, it's worked well for me.Yes; the form is here: https://ars.unc.edu/students/request-forms/connect-arsNot sure, but generally you can walk in and be seen for an initial consult in an hour.Not sure for faculty/staff. For students (including undergraduate TAs), DEI training is generally limited to freshman orientation, which I unfortunately can't remember at this point.This is a very complex question. Everyone I have personally encountered has been very understanding of my disability, and people generally are very enthusiastic about helping, though they are sometimes limited by lack of funding or lack of knowledge on how to help. However, ableism and discrimination (as well as stigmatizing) can be defined in multiple ways. Does lack of access to a program event count as discrimination? Does someone's (understandable, due to their lack of knowledge about why extra time between classes is medically necessary for some and also the fact that the imperfect system could be argued to give some students an unfair advantage in registration) exasperation or seeming anger at allowing priority registration, count as ableism? What about the various (unintended) barriers of construction that have required disabled students to somehow hop over broken sidewalks and/or signage in an attempt to find a curb cut, which inevitably leads to a part of the street where cars are, in order to access a class or event?Not that I know of, but we have various centers, organizations, and professors/staff/students who conduct research related to disability.I'm currently working on a project regarding mapping campus physical accessibility.

inaccessible,/user/Additional-Bus726/,UNC 2023,"For many of the ""weed out"" classes, the drain on students' mental health is clear. These classes try to squeeze too much material in a short amount of time. These classes usually are massive, making interactions with faculty harder and inaccessible. If students don't pass these weeder classes, this will mess up their entire college life, and possibly jeopardize their life plans. The anxiety definitely drives people insane.Then, there come other problems that further fuels stress, such as registration, financial problems (considering CH is extremely expensive), and so much more.This really boils down to how broken the UNC system is. Just adding peer tutoring, ULA, and sending out meaningless emails seems like a cheap way to ""pretend"" that the administration ""cares"" about its student. The whole structure of the school needs to change in order to make a meaningful change.On a side note, please take care of international students. International students fly to a completely different country with ZERO support. Everyday life is a struggle, and UNC, being this way, makes it impossible for international students to stay mentally sound. Add immigration complexities, life is much more miserable than students that call the US their home.",7 upvotes,https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/zbm2p6/are_you_students_okay_what_could_help/

However, that is not enough for me to feel comfortable on campus.You didn't mention this, but I'm going to touch on the CDC halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic individuals with covid, as this factors into my decision to pursue remote learning and is the most recent example of why I do not trust CDC recommendations.Here's an article from experts questioning the policy.

You've made it this far despite all the challenges in your way. But much more than that, you are you -- beautifully and wonderfully made. And nothing you will ever do or not do can change that.secondly -- most paths are not linear! Many people tell me that it's not a race; we all do what we need to do in our own time. Please prioritize your health first <3 I can't tell you what to do, but I can tell you about some options based on advice people have given me and/or the experiences of those I know:Campus Health gives people permission to do a medical underload (https://campushealth.unc.edu/services/medical-academic-interventions/) -- I've known several people who have taken one for many different reasons and who made me aware of the option! This might also help with requesting an additional year to complete your major. Did you meet with CS advising or general academic advising?While companies do fall/spring recruiting, tech also recruits year round. You may not be hired immediately (and I can't say anything definitive about the job market), but if there are people from outside tech backgrounds who end up in tech, you'll definitely have a good chance regardless of when you choose to go into the recruiting season.As for clubs/projects/internships -- everyone goes at their own pace, and courses come first. Not sure what your logistics are this summer, but I am actually looking for developers to help me with the backend and/or web client frontend of an accessible navigation app for universities.

health,/user/tomatosed/,Attending Another University,"As a current UMich student who is strongly considering transferring to UNC, I’ll add my input.The academics here are fantastic. You will have to work (hard) for your grades, but you learn so much - it feels worth it. Most professors I have had were very caring and willing to help outside of class, as well as being interesting people in general.The alumni network is almost unparalleled; I believe UMich has the largest living alumni group of any college (?) with alums in all major industries. Alumni look favorably on other Wolverines and will likely help you out if you try to connect with them. However I haven’t had firsthand experience with this as I’m not at the stage of my education where I’m seriously looking for employment yet. Also, UMich’s alumni network is pretty prevalent throughout the US and internationally - I’m from the West Coast and have had people tell me “Go Blue” many times when I was wearing Michigan merch.I think it’s pretty easy to change your major. You’re not required to declare a major until junior year and your freshman year will mainly be general prerequisites. Admittedly, I’m not in pre-health but none of my friends have had any issues with major declaration either. I don’t think this should be a worry for you.The people here are wonderful. 9/10 students are quite friendly, and there is an atmosphere of collaboration rather than competitiveness. It’s a “we’ll suffer together“ rather than a “I need to get ahead of you” mentality, which is great considering how stressful the school can be - this may differ with majors like Ross, but I’m in LSA and it’s great. There’s also a ton of school spirit. Football game days are electric, the entire campus comes alive. Ann Arbor is a good college town as well - very walkable, good restaurants with variety, cute downtown with lots of shops. It is very pricey, though, so be prepared to spend money. I come from a pretty high cost-of-living area and many of the prices in Ann Arbor were comparable to what I find back home.Your social life is what you make of it - if you sit in your room all day, chances are you won’t have a good time. But if you can find a solid group of friends, there’s always stuff to do. During the winter months, most of that “stuff” will be drinking though. There are also a lot of clubs here, so you can find people who share your interests, even the pretty niche ones. There’s a big work hard play hard mentality here, and parties are prevalent. Depending on your tastes, there’s frat parties, plenty of bars in town, or smaller house parties.And then there’s the weather. It is bad. Like really bad. I don’t know where you‘re from but this is a serious consideration that you may not be thinking hard enough about. During the winter months, it is overcast and cold 6 days out of a given week. It can be really depressing, and I know I didn’t consider weather enough when making my college decision. If you’re ready for Michigan winter, though, don’t let this dissuade you. Ann Arbor in the spring / summer is absolutely GORGEOUS, but we’re only on campus for maybe a month of the great weather.All in all, UMich is a great school with lots to offer. If you’re ready for the weather, you’ll have a great time. However, all the schools you’re considering are fantastic - I’d reckon UNC and UCLA have very similar things going for them. You should be proud and happy that you have such a wealth of good options!Reading back through it, this was a lot - sorry.
