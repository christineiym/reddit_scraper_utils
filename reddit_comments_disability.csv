    Hey there, sophomore in ECE here. I also felt the same way you did. I literally almost got suspended from how low my grades were. ðŸ˜¶ But I promise you it does get better. Go to TA office Hours, professor OH, go to 1-on-1 peer tutoring, go to Supplemental Instruction, go to clubs and meet upperclassmen and ask them for help as well if they're in your major, do many many practice problems, watch videos on the topics, maybe even visit the office of disability if you have accommodations they have great resources, if you're in Tartan Scholars DM me cause I can tell you more resources that they provide. Hope this helps!

    Most elected democrats had nothing to do with  the green new deal.  All that matters is what they passed in Congress which was a massive bailout to the overly expensive nuclear industry.  Solar and wind have been beating nuclear on price for a while now. But in general nobody wants to live near a nuclear power plant after three mile island which has made it more expensive and difficult to build.

Obama gave large subsidies to a new nuclear plant in Georgia.

    Have you been assessed for any disabilities?  Unless you know that you didnâ€™t put in the time, then the puzzling grade disasters may be a root cause. Go see the office of disability resources. It is never retroactive, but it could help you with a plan moving forward.

    Long Version. Based on my own experience and observations and discussions with others.
  
    You want advice on an Academic comeback. It doesnâ€™t exactly happen. Iâ€™m guessing what you mean by that is higher grades. Grades only mean so much. Yes you need to maintain a certain level to avoid probation (itâ€™s okay if you have to be there as well), and yes it makes it easier to get internships. But beyond that your goal is just to graduate. Up until this point grades have been the primary source of worth for many a CMU student but out in the real world your GPA isnâ€™t worth much. Experience is. You did the hard part. You made it into CMU. Now itâ€™s just crawling to the finish. This school can be tough even torturous at times but itâ€™s just another step. With that being said here are some lessons I learned along the way.
  


    Get some internship experience on your resume. There are very few ways of qualifying how much you know and how much you have learned at this school which can make it feel pointless. It wasnâ€™t until I started doing things that I learned both what I didnâ€™t want to do (which is a GOOD thing), and what I know. Applying your knowledge and learning new skills in an active environment is the best way to figure out what you want to do with the added bonus of making your GPA more and more irrelevant. Donâ€™t neglect your grades but it is indeed true. So true. Cs get degrees. But experience gets jobs.
  


    Donâ€™t plan your schedule based on what you think you need to do. Plan it based on what you can do. I made the mistake of taking five classes in one semester as a CIT major ONCE. Never again. Thatâ€™s not to say you canâ€™t do it. But I personally couldnâ€™t and thatâ€™s okay. I needed time for non school things. Music, Sports, The gym, Etc. All of these things help keep your mental health and your physical health in check which are both SO SO SO important. If your brain and body arenâ€™t working, your grades are gonna suck either way. Make time for yourself, and if you have trouble procrastinating find strategies to prevent it. These could look like scheduling out your time in a phone calendar, having friends call and remind you to do work, or putting yourself in specific locations to do a certain thing. Gates is study time. The UC is exercise and food. My room is for sleep and s.. well you get the point.
  


    College is about more than the academics. Itâ€™s the last place you will have training wheels. Itâ€™s also the last time youâ€™ll be in such a unique environment surrounded by thousands of people your age that are all trying to figure themselves out. Make friends. Go out. Explore. Adventure. Learn who you are, what you value, and find some meaning to all of this. Because once college is over. Training wheels are off.
  


    Go to therapy. I donâ€™t care what anyone says. You could be the most sane person. Having an objective third party to help rationalize things has worked wonders for me. If youâ€™re on the CMU insurance itâ€™s completely free. Just find a provider near campus that you can see once a week for an hour. Or if thatâ€™s too much investment I believe you can get a free virtual subscription to TimelyCare or something like that. Itâ€™s worth a shot and again is just a space to rant or complain or get advice for an hour a week. Itâ€™s an escape from all the crazy. Even if you are the crazy.
  


    Learn to reach out to resources BEFORE the dominoes fall. But especially once they start. The absolute worst thing your professor can do if you ask for help is to say no. Which is already where youâ€™re at in most cases. Soâ€¦ canâ€™t get worse. If you ask for help ahead of time, the second you know youâ€™ll need it. Youâ€™re much more likely to get it. Things happen last minute. Obviously. But when possible if you feel yourself slipping, your professors, your advisor, your campus liaison can all help if given enough time. Even office of disability resources if applicable. (Especially for point 4 if you get/have a diagnosis GET ACCOMMODATIONS. They are life changing at this school). Most importantly, for professor specifically, they want to see that youâ€™re not just trying to get a late day for the sake of it. By reaching out ahead of time, explaining your circumstances, and working with them to have a plan of action, you show that you want to succeed. You just need a little help. Or a little time. They wonâ€™t magically change your grades (most of the time) but asking for extensions when reasonable and when you have a plan on how to get the work done (or even just something they can help with), in my experience has yielded good results. Again I want to stress. This is not a guarantee but you are no worse off for asking.
  


    You might not be able to graduate in 8 semesters. It happens. It happened to me. Had to do a whole extra year. I also wanted to take some non major related classes (because learning about things that arenâ€™t your major is cool and you only have so many elective spots). Everyone goes at their own pace. A close friend of mine had to go on academic probation. Decided to take a year off. Came back after working that whole year and was a different person (in a good way). Better yet they had a job secure after college which is the goal anyways. School isnâ€™t for everyone. I for one am HORRIBLE at exams. Iâ€™ve taken classes where I finish labs faster than everyone else, get extra credit on them, homework average in the high 90s, but get killed by exams. Clearly I know the material. I just canâ€™t brain dump in 3 or so hours. Find what works for you. If that means 3 classes so be it. I also know the concern of finances exists. Itâ€™s real. I was a Tartan Scholar (so no money) and Iâ€™ve had to take out extra loans for this last year. But with the jobs I have lined up. That debt is gone in a year. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it but we are so close. Plus all my friends whoâ€™ve graduated, and most alumni I know as a matter of fact, have gotten bored after CMU. It seems the jobs of the real world just arenâ€™t as challenging. And hey, if this is as hard as it gets. Iâ€™ll take it.
  


    Self compassion is important. I spent two years comparing myself to someone who had straight As only to find out they never left their room with the exception of food, class, and the bathroom; were the son of a prominent member of the field they were studying (so they grew up doing the thing theyâ€™re good at); and didnâ€™t have many friends. These are the things we donâ€™t see. Try to keep them in mind. Remember that you made it to CMU, youâ€™re smart. Youâ€™re intelligent. You already put in so much work. And hey, if none of those are true and youâ€™ve made it this far. Youâ€™re just impressive.
  


    Keep your head up. Take it one day at a time.

    Hi! Like you, I have super bad test anxiety and have definitely failed a few tests due to test anxiety. :,) I feel like the things that helped me the most were 1. getting test extensions and 2. getting therapy to help with the anxiety itself. It seems that you've already pursued my first suggestion (although if you have 1.5x time, getting 2x time might help). When I talked to the people running the disability accommodation office, they basically explain that extra test time accommodations are like a band-aid to an actual problem, which is where the second suggestion comes in. Therapy specifically helping me practice anxiety regulation skills really helped me to the point where I don't need test taking extensions anymore.
  
    I can definitely relate to the second part of this post too. Doing terribly in a class that you put a lot of effort in and actually understand the material for due to bad test anxiety is actually the WORST :,,,,,,) I don't think I have the magic words to make you truly feel that you're not stupid for failing classes due to test anxiety, but if it helps coming from an internet stranger, you're not stupid! and I think that you're smart and will do great things despite your anxiety!
  
    I think the other people here have offered good suggestions assuming you'll be okay financially. And I think graduating a semester or 2 later is totally fine, although I can't really speak to that experience as much. I do know plenty of super smart people that graduated later than expected, and so I can say that it definitely doesn't mean that you're stupid, if that's what you're concerned about.
  
    I do hope you figure this out--if you have Qs feel free to DM!

    Dawnn Vith @ UHS (I think 412-268-9171) might be able to help. She can help get accommodations for short-term medical issues.
  
    Also, for finals/exams next semester so you can plan ahead in case this happens again, disability resources can help with longer term accommodation, so if you have a diagnosis they may be able to help with finals in the future.

    Dude! Reach out to the disability coordinator!!! There's a whole department on campus whose whole job is to support and have the back of students with disabiltiies-- and mental health is a disability! When I had a prof decide that me missing class due to health reasons meant that I didn't care enough about the major and should drop it, Disability Services went to the meeting with me and basically told him ""yeah, uh, you can't actually do that, fuck along now.""
  
    Anyway, CMU's disability services was one of the big reasons I ended up going there. Hugely recommend you reach out, for advice if nothing else. Good luck! Happy to advice more if it helps. <3

    If you want to do CS, why don't you go to the school where you're admitted to CS? How are you planning to pursue CS if you come to CMU (attempt a school transfer, pursue an additional major or minor, etc) -- this will affect my answer somewhat.
  
    I was admitted to both CMU and UMich for CS, so I know something about both of the schools (although financially UMich was a no-go from the start). I'll try and walk through your lists to see if I have anything to add:
  



    Both schools have incredible CS programs, but as a CIT student, you will not have an easy time transferring into the major if that is your goal. That being said, registration for CS courses is comparatively easy at CMU even for non-majors, so if you want to do a minor or something, that would be very possible (for additional majors, you'd really have to look at the coursework for CS and the engineering majors you are interested in to see how doable this is and whether you're willing to give up the scheduling freedom to do this. Don't plan on overloading before coming here).
  


    I Googled M-Engin and it sounds really really cool! lol nothing else to add here (we have a similar program called Tartan Scholars, but you would have gotten an invitation with your acceptance if invited I think).
  


    I do think you're right that CMU lags a little behind other universities in terms of racial and economic diversity, although it is superior to UMich in female representation in both engineering and CS. I didn't think this would be a big deal before I came (I'm female too fyi), but I find that it's pretty nice to not even have to think about gender dynamics in any of my classes. I've found CMU students to be unusually accepting of students of any background (race, class, politics, gender, gender identity, disability, etc)
  


    In terms of academic and social balance, I think it depends a lot on what you want and who you hang out with. If you're a college sports fan, you'll be disappointed here, but CMU students do absolutely party on the weekends and have fun. Pittsburgh is also a great city if you're interested in arts & culture (we have free admission to lots of area museums) and food, and we have free access to busses. Greek life is enjoyed by those who take part (it's probably not as big of a time commitment as at UMich); I don't know anyone who wanted to join a sorority and didn't get an offer to one, so if you're interested that should be available to you.
  


    Hate to break it to you, but winters suck in both Ann Arbor and Pittsburgh :)
  


    Weeder classes are absolutely not a thing at CMU. Classes are hard but the levels of support in them are truly incredible: professors really do care (and plan out their courses well), most TAs are undergrads rather than grad students so they've ""been there, done that,"" tend to be excellent at teaching, and are very passionate about their jobs (not just doing it to fulfill a requirement in their academic program); a lot of intro STEM classes have ""Supplemental Instruction,"" which is basically a guided study group with a student who excelled in the course and has been trained to provide support, and we have many ""teaching track"" professors whose sole job is to teach as well as they can and, if they conduct research, it is on how to teach their course better (and their insights are typically adopted by other professors as well).
  


    Oof, I'd be scared of the GPA requirement too
  


    Impostor syndrome is something you'll likely experience no matter where you go, but it doesn't have to be all-encompassing. The other thing is, if you mention it to your friends here (or probably at UMich also), they'll probably say ""same."" It's kind of a point of camaraderie
  


    Some CMU classes are large, others are small. Intro CS classes are typically 200+ per lecture  and intro math classes are often kept around 80 in my experience, but classes can get as small as 15 or 20. Recitations for large classes are often in the 15 to 30 range with 1-3 TAs
  


    Stress culture is unfortunately a thing at CMU, but it's very dependent on who you choose to surround yourself with. I just avoid the kind of people that like to brag about how busy they are and the like (it's not everyone) and I'm happier for it
  


    I would also think pretty hard about whether you'd enjoy the huge size of UMich (I know some people who go there, and they say it's a big part of their experience) and the relative anonymity that provides or the more close-knit environment of CMU.
  
    As my plug for CMU, I'll mention that the opportunities here are truly well beyond what I possibly could have imagined before coming here (even in a weird year like this one). I got a meaningful research position with a single email, students can begin TAing as early as spring of their freshman year, you can teach your own class (StuCos) if you're particularly passionate in something, you can take classes at any Pittsburgh university (so if you have a niche interest that's not covered here, you can probably learn about it nearby) and there are so many clubs/organizations to participate in.
  
    Good luck and congrats on your acceptances!

    Disability services! I would not have gotten through without them. If you have physical or mental disabilities or chronic conditions that might need accommodations of some sort, give them a shout! For my chronic pain issues, they did everything from buy me a better chair for the dorms to having my back with professors who were trying to give me shit.

    Hi!
  
    CMU's Office of Disability Resources would work with you to set up accommodations as necessary. For example, if you need extra time, they have a testing center to accommodate you. I am not a CS major nor have I used them, but they would be the best equipped to let you know the resources available. For what it's worth, I know CS majors with ADHD who did amazing. There's definitely support in place, and you should check for it at every school you apply to.
  
"
disability,,"

    Disability services would definitely be my first stop.
  
    No offense intended here, but how can you be sure that living off campus will be better?  Most apartment buildings in Pittsburgh aren't built too differently than the dorms - by which I mean that while you'll get more living space and a kitchen and bathroom to yourself, you'll still be on a floor full of lots of other people and probably between floors of even more.  Plus, many of the buildings near campus will also be full of students who may be equally loud and noisy.
  
    The advantage of staying on campus may be that they can better accommodate your needs.  Be sure to carefully weigh your options. Typically, once you move off campus it's hard to move back on again.
  
"

    You could also potentially contact Disability resources. Even though this particular situation may not be within the scope of their services, they might be able to provide you with more information about the correct people and resources to contact in order to navigate this situation.

    What I’ll say with regards to this: Falstad is a great resource for building intuition with regard to circuits. Playing with it in high school was honestly enough to carry me through basically all of the circuits in 100 and 220.
  
    If you know what you’re doing, you can probably solve basically every circuits hw problem through 220 and lots of 320 with it, but you’ll just be handicapping yourself in the long run. Rather id use something like this to supplement learning. I found CMU to be pretty horrendous in terms of teaching circuit design methodology, so designing circuits in falstad is a good way to practice before you are introduced to more advanced tools

    I volunteer with a program where citizens are “deputized” to ticket assholes parking in handicap spots without a handicap tag. It is absolutely inarguably true that, in my area at least, expensive, show-offy cars are by FAR the most likely to do this. But they’re “just running in!” Lexus, BMW and land rovers, with Mercedes close behind, are the most frequent cars I ticket by a large margin.

    If you really want to know the actual reason for it, I believe itâ€™s because there was a school for the blind in the area once upon a time so the walk cycle time is longer than usual in order to allow the disabled to cross safely. This is also why itâ€™s a four way walk cycle rather than two and two. In order to not completely destroy the flow of traffic because of that, the walk cycle is only set to enter into the traffic cycle when the button is pressed.

Things happen last minute. Obviously. But when possible if you feel yourself slipping, your professors, your advisor, your campus liaison can all help if given enough time. Even office of disability resources if applicable. (Especially for point 4 if you get/have a diagnosis GET ACCOMMODATIONS. They are life changing at this school). Most importantly, for professor specifically, they want to see that youâ€™re not just trying to get a late day for the sake of it. By reaching out ahead of time, explaining your circumstances, and working with them to have a plan of action, you show that you want to succeed. You just need a little help. Or a little time. They wonâ€™t magically change your grades (most of the time) but asking for extensions when reasonable and when you have a plan on how to get the work done (or even just something they can help with), in my experience has yielded good results. Again I want to stress. This is not a guarantee but you are no worse off for asking.
  


    You might not be able to graduate in 8 semesters. It happens. It happened to me. Had to do a whole extra year. I also wanted to take some non major related classes (because learning about things that arenâ€™t your major is cool and you only have so many elective spots). Everyone goes at their own pace. A close friend of mine had to go on academic probation. Decided to take a year off. Came back after working that whole year and was a different person (in a good way). Better yet they had a job secure after college which is the goal anyways. School isnâ€™t for everyone. I for one am HORRIBLE at exams. Iâ€™ve taken classes where I finish labs faster than everyone else, get extra credit on them, homework average in the high 90s, but get killed by exams. Clearly I know the material. I just canâ€™t brain dump in 3 or so hours. Find what works for you. If that means 3 classes so be it. I also know the concern of finances exists. Itâ€™s real. I was a Tartan Scholar (so no money) and Iâ€™ve had to take out extra loans for this last year. But with the jobs I have lined up. That debt is gone in a year. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d make it but we are so close. Plus all my friends whoâ€™ve graduated, and most alumni I know as a matter of fact, have gotten bored after CMU. It seems the jobs of the real world just arenâ€™t as challenging. And hey, if this is as hard as it gets. Iâ€™ll take it.
  


    Self compassion is important. I spent two years comparing myself to someone who had straight As only to find out they never left their room with the exception of food, class, and the bathroom; were the son of a prominent member of the field they were studying (so they grew up doing the thing theyâ€™re good at); and didnâ€™t have many friends. These are the things we donâ€™t see. Try to keep them in mind. Remember that you made it to CMU, youâ€™re smart. Youâ€™re intelligent. You already put in so much work. And hey, if none of those are true and youâ€™ve made it this far. Youâ€™re just impressive.

    Dude! Reach out to the disability coordinator!!! There's a whole department on campus whose whole job is to support and have the back of students with disabiltiies-- and mental health is a disability! When I had a prof decide that me missing class due to health reasons meant that I didn't care enough about the major and should drop it, Disability Services went to the meeting with me and basically told him ""yeah, uh, you can't actually do that, fuck along now.""
  
    Anyway, CMU's disability services was one of the big reasons I ended up going there. Hugely recommend you reach out, for advice if nothing else. Good luck! Happy to advice more if it helps. <3

Industry applicability?



    As my flair says, I am not currently in industry.
  


    However, I was lucky enough to intern at one of the AWS database teams for a summer. At that point, I had taken 440, 445, 721.
  


    My summer was basically spent staring at perf, reducing contention, and optimizing code. Something like: my manager thinks X is a bottleneck, can I prove it? how much can it be improved? (Incidentally, it is possible to make a system too fast. Extra work that is generated like garbage collection and replication has to be able to keep up, otherwise you run the risk of instability. Unless you're a HFT shop and you do the ""buy more RAM, disable GC, restart daily"" strategy [5]. Systems are fun! but I digress.)
  


    On applicability: unsurprisingly, the database courses 445 and 721 were the most relevant, followed probably by 440 (for general background knowledge / ""systems thinking""). In retrospect and counterfactually, 410 and 418 are more in the ""arguably useful background information but also not really necessary"".
  


    One shortcoming IMO of our current systems curriculum is that we do not really seem to have an emphasis on performance profiling and optimization anywhere. If you knew the courses and their projects, you'd think that would be 418, but at least in the semester I took it, that wasn't the case. You can get your systems concentration without really ingraining something like [6]. If you care about this, I suggest picking it up in your own time during winter break or something. Brendan Gregg [7] and Agner Fog [8] are both good resources.
  


    In general, I would be surprised if 440 and 445 did not appear on a ""most broadly applicable"" list from someone who's taken those courses. With that said, there are definitely jobs out there where 410 (VMWare? assuming they will still exist post Broadcom...) or 411 (many different compilers teams) or 418 (probably scientific computing), etc, are the most applicable. It depends on what you want to do.
  
The margin over self-study

    Rather than run through each course, I will list out various factors that you might want to consider.
  


    Internship opportunities: some courses bring in companies and engineers with recruiting power (not recruiters! there's a difference), e.g., 445 usually does this, storage systems does this too. This is a huge opportunity, don't skip guest lectures! These are often a ticket to actually working on systems in industry, either as an intern or full-time.
  


    Research opportunities: most courses transition naturally into research opportunities with the professors that taught it. If you want to do research, you usually should get started by junior year -- this doesn't leave you a lot of time, so you should strategically pick courses here.
  


    Availability of material: not all courses are equally available online. Everything in 445 is online except for the exams (though as a CMU student with the chance to take it, I think it would be a mistake to self-study it). Not much is online for 410's project infrastructure.
  


    Project discipline: it is highly unlikely (though possible) that you will write your own OS or compiler if coursework isn't making you do so.
  


    There are probably more factors, but I notice I've been writing this comment for over an hour and I should either go back to sleep or start doing work, so I'm cutting it short here.
  
Side note 1

    Although I did not take 411, someone whose opinion I trust a lot says that it was one of their most useful courses. They did compilers research and currently work in the low-latency high-performance space. It certainly has much better developed infrastructure than most of the other systems courses, and is likely to be better structured in general. I would consider trying to fit this into your course schedule somewhere.
  
Side note 2

    I strongly encourage you to consider taking at least one grad course. These tend to be less work and more research/reading heavy. In my opinion, you should learn how to read industry research papers, so that you can keep up with the field even when you're done with CMU.
  
Side note 3

    If you take a partner project course with a friend, you may want to be prepared to solo the course or lose that friend (and possibly some of your friend group with them). I have been aware of multiple situations in 410, 411, etc. where one person does the majority of the work and the other coasts to an A. I'm not talking about a 60/40 split of work either, which IMO is still reasonable -- think 90/10 or 95/5. It's a team effort and the exact breakdown of work doesn't matter that much, but sometimes the team practically speaking is just you.
  
    This is written assuming that you'll usually be on the contributing side of things (that you like doing a systems concentration more than the idea of doing a systems concentration). Otherwise, pretend you never read this. :) In retrospect, I lucked out massively with my OS partner and I think he's the only partner I had where I think I was less critical to the project (40/60 to 45/55 seems like a fair assessment).
  
Side note 4

    I'm pretty passionate about our undergrad CS curriculum -- I genuinely think it is one of the best and broadest at an undergrad level -- and this is particularly the case for our systems offerings, which aim to get you to really write code. Most people don't write enough code. I always thought it would be nice to have a more established undergrad systems community. If you want to chat more about our systems courses or curriculum, feel free to DM.

    If you want to do CS, why don't you go to the school where you're admitted to CS? How are you planning to pursue CS if you come to CMU (attempt a school transfer, pursue an additional major or minor, etc) -- this will affect my answer somewhat.
  
    I was admitted to both CMU and UMich for CS, so I know something about both of the schools (although financially UMich was a no-go from the start). I'll try and walk through your lists to see if I have anything to add:
  



    Both schools have incredible CS programs, but as a CIT student, you will not have an easy time transferring into the major if that is your goal. That being said, registration for CS courses is comparatively easy at CMU even for non-majors, so if you want to do a minor or something, that would be very possible (for additional majors, you'd really have to look at the coursework for CS and the engineering majors you are interested in to see how doable this is and whether you're willing to give up the scheduling freedom to do this. Don't plan on overloading before coming here).
  


    I Googled M-Engin and it sounds really really cool! lol nothing else to add here (we have a similar program called Tartan Scholars, but you would have gotten an invitation with your acceptance if invited I think).
  


    I do think you're right that CMU lags a little behind other universities in terms of racial and economic diversity, although it is superior to UMich in female representation in both engineering and CS. I didn't think this would be a big deal before I came (I'm female too fyi), but I find that it's pretty nice to not even have to think about gender dynamics in any of my classes. I've found CMU students to be unusually accepting of students of any background (race, class, politics, gender, gender identity, disability, etc)
  


    In terms of academic and social balance, I think it depends a lot on what you want and who you hang out with. If you're a college sports fan, you'll be disappointed here, but CMU students do absolutely party on the weekends and have fun. Pittsburgh is also a great city if you're interested in arts & culture (we have free admission to lots of area museums) and food, and we have free access to busses. Greek life is enjoyed by those who take part (it's probably not as big of a time commitment as at UMich); I don't know anyone who wanted to join a sorority and didn't get an offer to one, so if you're interested that should be available to you.
  


    Hate to break it to you, but winters suck in both Ann Arbor and Pittsburgh :)
  


    Weeder classes are absolutely not a thing at CMU. Classes are hard but the levels of support in them are truly incredible: professors really do care (and plan out their courses well), most TAs are undergrads rather than grad students so they've ""been there, done that,"" tend to be excellent at teaching, and are very passionate about their jobs (not just doing it to fulfill a requirement in their academic program); a lot of intro STEM classes have ""Supplemental Instruction,"" which is basically a guided study group with a student who excelled in the course and has been trained to provide support, and we have many ""teaching track"" professors whose sole job is to teach as well as they can and, if they conduct research, it is on how to teach their course better (and their insights are typically adopted by other professors as well).
  


    Oof, I'd be scared of the GPA requirement too
  


    Impostor syndrome is something you'll likely experience no matter where you go, but it doesn't have to be all-encompassing. The other thing is, if you mention it to your friends here (or probably at UMich also), they'll probably say ""same."" It's kind of a point of camaraderie
  


    Some CMU classes are large, others are small. Intro CS classes are typically 200+ per lecture  and intro math classes are often kept around 80 in my experience, but classes can get as small as 15 or 20. Recitations for large classes are often in the 15 to 30 range with 1-3 TAs
  


    Stress culture is unfortunately a thing at CMU, but it's very dependent on who you choose to surround yourself with. I just avoid the kind of people that like to brag about how busy they are and the like (it's not everyone) and I'm happier for it
  


    I would also think pretty hard about whether you'd enjoy the huge size of UMich (I know some people who go there, and they say it's a big part of their experience) and the relative anonymity that provides or the more close-knit environment of CMU.
  
    As my plug for CMU, I'll mention that the opportunities here are truly well beyond what I possibly could have imagined before coming here (even in a weird year like this one). I got a meaningful research position with a single email, students can begin TAing as early as spring of their freshman year, you can teach your own class (StuCos) if you're particularly passionate in something, you can take classes at any Pittsburgh university (so if you have a niche interest that's not covered here, you can probably learn about it nearby) and there are so many clubs/organizations to participate in.
  
    Good luck and congrats on your acceptances!

    Hey there, sophomore in ECE here. I also felt the same way you did. I literally almost got suspended from how low my grades were. ðŸ˜¶ But I promise you it does get better. Go to TA office Hours, professor OH, go to 1-on-1 peer tutoring, go to Supplemental Instruction, go to clubs and meet upperclassmen and ask them for help as well if they're in your major, do many many practice problems, watch videos on the topics, maybe even visit the office of disability if you have accommodations they have great resources, if you're in Tartan Scholars DM me cause I can tell you more resources that they provide. Hope this helps!

    Long Version. Based on my own experience and observations and discussions with others.
  
    You want advice on an Academic comeback. It doesnâ€™t exactly happen. Iâ€™m guessing what you mean by that is higher grades. Grades only mean so much. Yes you need to maintain a certain level to avoid probation (itâ€™s okay if you have to be there as well), and yes it makes it easier to get internships. But beyond that your goal is just to graduate. Up until this point grades have been the primary source of worth for many a CMU student but out in the real world your GPA isnâ€™t worth much. Experience is. You did the hard part. You made it into CMU. Now itâ€™s just crawling to the finish. This school can be tough even torturous at times but itâ€™s just another step. With that being said here are some lessons I learned along the way.
  


    Get some internship experience on your resume. There are very few ways of qualifying how much you know and how much you have learned at this school which can make it feel pointless. It wasnâ€™t until I started doing things that I learned both what I didnâ€™t want to do (which is a GOOD thing), and what I know. Applying your knowledge and learning new skills in an active environment is the best way to figure out what you want to do with the added bonus of making your GPA more and more irrelevant. Donâ€™t neglect your grades but it is indeed true. So true. Cs get degrees. But experience gets jobs.
  


    Donâ€™t plan your schedule based on what you think you need to do. Plan it based on what you can do. I made the mistake of taking five classes in one semester as a CIT major ONCE. Never again. Thatâ€™s not to say you canâ€™t do it. But I personally couldnâ€™t and thatâ€™s okay. I needed time for non school things. Music, Sports, The gym, Etc. All of these things help keep your mental health and your physical health in check which are both SO SO SO important. If your brain and body arenâ€™t working, your grades are gonna suck either way. Make time for yourself, and if you have trouble procrastinating find strategies to prevent it. These could look like scheduling out your time in a phone calendar, having friends call and remind you to do work, or putting yourself in specific locations to do a certain thing. Gates is study time. The UC is exercise and food. My room is for sleep and s.. well you get the point.
  


    College is about more than the academics. Itâ€™s the last place you will have training wheels. Itâ€™s also the last time youâ€™ll be in such a unique environment surrounded by thousands of people your age that are all trying to figure themselves out. Make friends. Go out. Explore. Adventure. Learn who you are, what you value, and find some meaning to all of this. Because once college is over. Training wheels are off.
  


    Go to therapy. I donâ€™t care what anyone says. You could be the most sane person. Having an objective third party to help rationalize things has worked wonders for me. If youâ€™re on the CMU insurance itâ€™s completely free. Just find a provider near campus that you can see once a week for an hour. Or if thatâ€™s too much investment I believe you can get a free virtual subscription to TimelyCare or something like that. Itâ€™s worth a shot and again is just a space to rant or complain or get advice for an hour a week. Itâ€™s an escape from all the crazy. Even if you are the crazy.
  


    Learn to reach out to resources BEFORE the dominoes fall. But especially once they start. The absolute worst thing your professor can do if you ask for help is to say no.

    Hi! Like you, I have super bad test anxiety and have definitely failed a few tests due to test anxiety. :,) I feel like the things that helped me the most were 1. getting test extensions and 2. getting therapy to help with the anxiety itself. It seems that you've already pursued my first suggestion (although if you have 1.5x time, getting 2x time might help). When I talked to the people running the disability accommodation office, they basically explain that extra test time accommodations are like a band-aid to an actual problem, which is where the second suggestion comes in. Therapy specifically helping me practice anxiety regulation skills really helped me to the point where I don't need test taking extensions anymore.
  
    I can definitely relate to the second part of this post too. Doing terribly in a class that you put a lot of effort in and actually understand the material for due to bad test anxiety is actually the WORST :,,,,,,) I don't think I have the magic words to make you truly feel that you're not stupid for failing classes due to test anxiety, but if it helps coming from an internet stranger, you're not stupid! and I think that you're smart and will do great things despite your anxiety!
  
    I think the other people here have offered good suggestions assuming you'll be okay financially. And I think graduating a semester or 2 later is totally fine, although I can't really speak to that experience as much. I do know plenty of super smart people that graduated later than expected, and so I can say that it definitely doesn't mean that you're stupid, if that's what you're concerned about.

    coming back after looking a bit more at context:
  
    i did get an academic suspension but i was able to appeal it. if you get off of academic probation after an appeal, you get a reset in a sense, so even if you have another bad semester you will just be put on academic probation again first.
  
    i took a leave of absence and in my time off i was lucky enough to be able to go through a therapy program that focused on teaching me skills for success and figuring out what works for me. afterwards i just got a job and worked full time until i was able to get back to school. i switched majors to something that suited me a lot more. i also really recommend getting accommodations if you do stay in school.
  
    other things to consider: do you know what exactly is giving you a hard time? are the classes simply too hard? do you hate the classes? are you unable to bring yourself to put in the effort needed? depending on the exact cause, there are very different courses of action you can take.

    Hey! I understand the stress. It's a really jarring email to receive, but you and everyone else in your class actually are almost certainly OK. CMU predicted there wouldn't be and still isn't seeing any in-class spread. It's happening outside of them, yes, but not in. Between specific ventilation systems, masks, and everyone being vaccinated, your risk actually is very, very low.
  
    I understand being nervous, though. If you want, you can see what accommodations the professor may be willing to give you. I hope this helps!

    Leases for the next fall generally start coming up in January/February because that's when current residents decide to re-sign for the next year. Additionally, room selection for the fall happens through CMU in late February so people often like to lock down their off campus accommodations before that just in case things fall through and they can get on campus housing.
  

    Personally when I moved off campus, I found my roomate in November, applied for our lease in December, and then signed it in January. You can do it later, but Jan/Feb is when leases generally come up. I took over my lease from a friend, so we also had to do it earlier so that they didn't put the appartment out on the general market before we signed.

    Hi!
  
    CMU's Office of Disability Resources would work with you to set up accommodations as necessary. For example, if you need extra time, they have a testing center to accommodate you. I am not a CS major nor have I used them, but they would be the best equipped to let you know the resources available. For what it's worth, I know CS majors with ADHD who did amazing. There's definitely support in place, and you should check for it at every school you apply to.

    Besides reaching out to CAPs, maybe get an external therapist? CAPs therapists are not exactly known for being the best. I think letting your academic advisor know this is going on may be helpful - if you ever require extensions or something, having your advisor already informed about your situation is definitely a benefit. They can (hopefully) serve as an additional advocate to get necessary accommodations.
  
    Iâ€™m so sorry for your losses. CMU is hard (even without external stressors), but you have worked so hard to get to this point and have been accepted for a reason. You are capable of handling the academic environment here - donâ€™t let yourself think differently.

    I'm a freshman who lived in Clyde House last semester. In terms of location, it's a ten minute walk from campus, so it was a pain for me as many locations on campus were not open to stay at between classes. This should not be the case next year, so as long as you are okay leaving your room for the day it's not really an issue. A bike was definitely helpful, tho. Another annoyance were the construction noises from the directly adjacent Fifth and Clyde project that would wake you up at 6:30 every weekday. It is a new dorm building so I think it's set to be done by August.
  
    One advantage you get with all of the dorms, I believe in that area (incl. Highland, Neville, Rez, Mudge (?), the new one) is a kitchenette and the option to buy a leaner meal plan, which could save you a few thousand dollars if you like to cook.
  
    In regards to the house itself, I can't complain. The ACs didn't work well but that seems par for the course. The laundry room is adequate, two washers two dryers, and there are a few pieces of exercize  equipment (although I recommend running the neighborhood off to the east, there's some nice scenery and cool architecture and that). The main living room is cozy and there's a smaller ""study room"" on the second floor, plenty of socializing room. My room (that I lived in by myself due to covid) had a bay window, which was cool. And how could I forget the private bathrooms! Those are quite a luxury at any mid-campus dorm.
  
    My best testimonial to the accommodations may be this: when my fridge broke one day later in the evening and I called maintenance, the Oakland facility coordinator (Clif) arrived at my door with a new one in what felt like fifteen minutes (and I was on the second floor!). All in all I'd recommend it.
  
    Sorry for the deluge of words, but I was one of only ten living there last semester, and I figured I might as well give you all I'd had since you might not hear from anyone else.
  
    P.S. even if there aren't any official tours, try and find a nice day to come visit and walk around if you can. Give Schenley Park a go too if that's your thing. I feel like the virtual material provided by CMU doesn't do the campus justice. Hope I could help :)

accommodations,,"

    I graduated a few years and also have a mild case of Dyslexia.  The school and professors are  fair and responsive to setting up accommodations if you need them.  Reach out to the Office of Disability Resources.  If you choose to let it CMU will challenge and push you to new hights.  The core cs program is demanding but doable and very rewarding.  I feel very well prepared for the work force.  I specialized in robotics and have worked for a few self driving programs,  I have been able to leverage a lot of my education and feel that I came into the workforce knowing things which I have had to teach coworkers.  Your heart should be in it, and the program is not perfect but CMU is definitely manageable and can set you up for a great career.

accessibility,,"

    The biggest reason was that I didn't want to commit to a niche at the time. I liked making games, but did I want to major in making games? I wasn't sure. I realized during semester 1 at CMU I'd rather make applications using game engine tools instead and that led me to approaching my education very differently. I ended up figuring out what niche I wanted to be in and made my own major (yes you can do that 😉 and I knew that coming in) to let me do it without worrying about requirements.
  
    As for the rest.. At CMU I'd be an art major (very very flexible program), at RPI I'd be GSAS (kind of rigid). The upside of GSAS is that when you're going up to recruiters during career fairs or job apps you're not gonna get instant rejection.
  
    I had concerns of the competence of RPI's administration and the funding (lack thereof) to some programs. RPI reddit was also super pessimistic.Compared to CMU, RPI is in the middle of nowhere and I don't have a car. CMU also has better name and over all higher quality of people than RPI does. I liked RPI's VR accessibility (cuz I do vr/AR stuff), but if you're in CMU's CFA you can get $500 grants to buy your own hardware. CMU is more generous with financial aid. RPI campus is larger and more depressing than ours is IMO.

    You probably won’t be able to attend department specific orientation virtually. Some of the university wide stuff gets posted online (Canvas “course” that covers general orientation).
  
    Our expensive university isn’t great with modern accessibility (read: not at all). I would recommend asking people in your department if it’s vital to attend—I 100% could have skipped mine last fall and not have missed anything (because I read everything available prior to getting here) other than putting names and faces together for my cohort.

    From email this morning:
  

    Dear Members of the CMU Community:
  


    I am writing to advise you that an invitation-only campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris will take place on Carnegie Mellon’s campus today. Please note that access to certain buildings and walkways may be limited on Wednesday, and we ask that you be mindful of any wayfinding restrictions.
  


    Given this activity, it is important to review the rules and regulations governing campaign events on campus. All nonprofit institutions, such as CMU, must follow federal regulations in hosting or sponsoring campaign events. For instance, employee and student organizations can invite a candidate to speak on campus and the university may agree to host the event, but federal regulations require a comparable invitation to all other candidates for that office. Campaigns must cover the cost of using a CMU space and cannot hold fundraisers on campus. In each instance, the university works closely with a campaign to ensure adherence to safety, proper logistical coordination and minimal disruption to campus operations. For more details on expectations and requirements for political events on campus, review these FAQs.
  


    This event is a clear reminder that we are entering the final weeks before the Nov. 5 general election and political activity on and around our campus is growing. Thank you in advance for cooperation during this election season.
  


    Respectfully,
  


    Daryl Weinert Vice President for Operations Carnegie Mellon University

    Phone numbers were still sequential down the dorm halls.  (Guessing the dorms don't even have landlines these days)  Few buildings or classrooms were locked at any point unless there was lab/computer equipment.  Most (all?) of the computer labs were staffed 24x7.

    What is your source on that?  Many countries in Europe have top rates over 50%.  Anyway, capital gains, carried interest and pass through income allow many rich people to avoid income tax in the U.S.  But regardless of how progressive the tax code is, that’s despite republicans efforts to get the rates lower.  And yet we still manage to fail at helping mothers.  We have some of the least health care access for mothers after birth, we have near zero after school and summer child care, no paid leave after birth, and the list goes on and on.  Good news is we have enough fighter jets and nuclear bombs to destroy the whole world.  Let’s get into how much of a failure and waste of money so many defense project are like the f22, f35, littoral combat ships. Look at those if you are wondering where all the tax money has gone.  Yet Republicans don’t skip a beat at throwing money down the drain at these programs bc it’s their donors who benefit.  Meanwhile you are upset that the government is trying to expand electric cars and clean up the air so we don’t have embarrassingly high levels of childhood asthma in poor neighborhoods.   To me, the obsession with abortion smells like a power grab and quest for control and not a genuine concern for babies and children

    In the US top rates are also over 50% in many places… not to mention capital gains taxes are already taxed as corporate income before being taxed as capital gains.
  

    But on average fed plus state is 42% which is below a lot of other countries

    Nearly every single mother has access to healthcare after birth.
  

    In many Republican states it is for a limited time period of a year.  Democratic states have higher taxes to pay for healthcare for parents beyond one year
  

    Women get paid leave after birth. 
  

    Not at the federal level.  Any leave taken is unpaid unless you are in 13 democrat controlled states. And even in those states it is limited compared to what other countries have.
  

    PS; I would  believe democrats actually wanted electric cars and cleaner air if they supported nuclear energy instead of trying to kill it. 
  

    Most democrats support nuclear.  Biden’s infrastructure law has massive subsidies for nuclear power plants new and old.  Ironically the biggest anti nuclear advocate in the country RFK jr endorsed and joined the Republican ticket.  California decided to ignore the anti nuclear crowed and keep their plant running.  Some democrats have issues  with old plants in dangerous locations but aren’t totally anti nuclear.  It would also help if we had a real plan for the waste and a better way to mine uranium in the grand canyon without polluting the Colorado River which millions depend on for water.

    Then all you have to do is email - again, other departments can’t necessarily view your admission materials/undergrad background to know you met the prerequisite.

    Feom my personal experience, i'd say cmu is very enjoyable if you tend to follow through with the motto ""my heart is in the works"". People are not necessarily overcompetitive, but everywhere you look, there are a big portion of students overloading, double majoring/taking dual degrees/graduating with masters degree in 4 years or less etc. And intership in freshman summer is very very common. You feel compelled to do more and learn more. Even in student clubs, people are being a big nerds (in a good way) in what they are interested in.
  
    As for the city, the food scene is a bit poor (unless you have a car and can drive around more). Perforance art wise, there are lots of recitals and almost free (5-10 bucks) student performace tickets avalibale thruought the year. Lots of students, professors, staffs, and local residents come to see the performace. Professional performances are avalible all year around, such as the pittsburgh symphony, opera etc. All located in downtown and accessible via busses.
  
    If you are enjoy being surrounded by people who are extremely passionate about what they do, CMU is definitly a great place for you. If you would like your college years to be more enjoyable with some more parties hangouts and other relaxing things other than academics, then you might want to rethink about coming to CMU.

    I took 15-459 with Prof O'Donnell, and it was one of my favorite classes at CMU. With O'Donnell the class was purely theoretical, i.e. involved no actual programming of quantum computers, but it was fascinating nonetheless to learn about various quantum algorithms and the strangely limited power that quantum computation seems to provide over traditional computing.
  
    Indeed, the class was quite accessible, requiring no knowledge of physics or quantum mechanics. The relevant foundations necessary to understand quantum computing were explained from the ground up.

    As the course descriptions suggest, 21-242 is a more demanding version of 21-241, encompassing a broader scope and placing increased emphasis on rigorous proofs. I passed the math maturity survey and subsequently enrolled in both courses for a short period. It's important to note that there are three different versions of 21241 itself: 21241 lecture 1, 21241 lecture 2, and 21241 lecture 3.
  
    21241 omits certain topics found in 21242, including Hermitian and unitary matrices as well as quadratic forms. In contrast, 21241 lecture 2 offers a valuable learning experience by incorporating Julia programming, a feature absent in 21242.
  
    21241 lecture 3 is designed for math majors, 21241 lecture 2 is tailored for computer science majors, while 21241 lecture 1 is the easiest and intended for other students. I opted for 21241 lecture 2 and also took 21242. I particularly enjoyed 21241 lecture 2 because it includes instruction on the Julia programming language, especially in the final project. Although 21242 comes with more challenging homework assignments, I believe that earning an A in it may be more achievable if you invest more effort into homework.
  
    The final exam carries a larger weight in determining the final grades for 21241, whereas the final exams in 21242 don't have as much percentage. If you excel in 21242 homework, it's comparatively easier to secure an A compared to 21241 which largely depends on your exams.
  
    It's important to clarify that the statement ""a C in 242 would translate to an A in 241"" is not accurate. In fact, if you intend to take 21269, the subsequent honors course, you'll need a B in 21242 or an A in 21241.
  
    For those interested in the honors program, I would advise against enrolling in 21259. Instead, you should consider taking 21269. You have the option to choose only one of the following courses: 21256 (for business majors), 21259 (the standard, more accessible course), 21266 (designed for computer science majors), 21268 (a serious course), or 21269 (an honors course).

    Grad school can be all work and little fun if you make it that way. Masters students tend to have this worse than PhD students in my experience. If you want to go out every weekend and many weeknights there are definitely grad students here who do. Most of the social scene in Pittsburgh isn't downtown so I wouldn't worry about being far from there. Shadyside has a lot of fun bars and restaurants, and many grad students live there. Squirrel hill has less night life but more restaurants and easier access to Shenley and Frick parks, and also many grad students. Strip District and Lawerenceville have a lot to do as well, but are both pretty far from campus but no direct bus routes from Strip District, so not many grad students live there. Most of the bigger clubs/DJs etc. are in Lawerenceville, Strip District and North Shore, which are mostly accessible by Uber/Lyft, and to a lesser extent bus. Squirrel Hill also has many bus routes to Waterfront that has lots of comedy shows, an escape room, and AMC movie theater. Oakland has the Carnegie Museum of Arts, Soldiers and Sailors museum, Phipps Conservatory (might actually be in Squirrel Hill but its close), a lot of bars, and a lot of grad students and undergrads from Pitt. The bar scene there skews more undergrad than grad student. South Side has a lot of bars but is more of an undegrad scene

    Wow, I didn't know KGB took over Readme. I used to write for readme when I was at CMU. We had a WordPress site - not sure if it's still up, though.
  
    Edit: apparently KGB also has a wiki page detailing readme's history, which briefly mentions me. Turns out there's a wiki page for me. Who knew?
  
    Also, for posterity, the newer KGB issues of Readme are available here: https://cmureadme.com/

    Edit 2: I also found an old Facebook page for readme - the links don't work anymore, but it might help anyone looking for article titles: https://www.facebook.com/cmureadme/

    And here's a single issue from October 2003, found deep within the Google results: https://www.scribd.com/document/426633132/Readme-Issue-2003-10-01

    Edit 3: Oh hey, I found the ""swimsuit edition"" with my face on the cover thanks to a post on this subreddit - which led me to the discovery that I can still access the old readme site on WordPress, even though it's not public anymore. And some of our past issues are on there! If there's anything I can do to help archive them properly, feel free to let me know.
  
    (Oddly, the newer WordPress site seems to be inaccessible now - unlike the older one, it doesn't prompt me to log in.)
  
    Edit 4: Oh snap, the newer WP site still exists too! It should have a more complete archive, hopefully.

    Similar situation: had to take 5 classes this semester for my additional major and am also TAing a math class. I got a small cold last week and I’m now both behind on all my work and the cold extended to a sinus infection because I didn’t rest and recover properly. That said, I won’t say don’t do it if you’re passionate enough (I don’t regret doing this, just would not recommend it). Here’s my advice
  


    Take easier classes. By easier, don’t just consider average workload but rather peak workload during crunch weeks like midterm weeks or last week of the semester. 1 or 2 non-tech.s without midterms or large projects will make those times a lot easier
  


    Be up front with the professor you TA for. Unlike FCEs, if a TA job says expect 10-12 hours per week, you should expect 10-12 hours per week, and expect more the first couple weeks. New TAs for my class were told to expect 10-14 hours per week and many had to do upwards of 15 the first 2 weeks because of over enrollment. If your prof will need you to consistently work 15, that’s very different from a situation where you average 12 and occasionally do 10. Communicate and find something that works for both of you.
  


    Your grades will slip a little. That’s just what happens when you get busier, so make sure you have a little space to slip and accept that it might happen. So many homework’s the last few weeks I’ve half assed and submitted and then just not had the time to come back to and check. This doesn’t mean you learn less or aren’t as smart, it’s just a trade off you should be willing to make.
  


    Don’t forget about your friends. On paper, I have enough time for social stuff, but in reality, I haven’t gamed with my friends in 2 weeks and I spent this past weekend making up for neglecting my friends the weekend before. Sacrifices will have to be made, but if you make too many you’ll burn out and endanger whats really important, so be mindful
  


    Have fun with it. The reason I’m still standing after midterm week is because I both enjoy the things I’m learning in class and I really love TAing. If you have classes you don’t care about and are TAing a class you don’t really really love, you’re just gonna get frustrated that you have to do it. I can keep going because even though I’m overworked, I’m satisfied and I like the person I’m becoming by doing this.
  


    DO NOT NEGLECT YOUR HEALTH. Overworked ≠ sleep deprived. I’ve slept more this semester than freshman fall when I had half the workload. If you start to get sick, go to uhs (seriously, my sinuses are killing me), get extensions, take a break. Going to dinner with friends  or getting an extra 3 hours of sleep is worth 5% of an assignment or 5% on a midterm from studying one less night. The only way to manage heavier workloads is to do it in a sustainable way, otherwise you’ll just start burning out before fall break can save you.

    First and foremost: stop “justifying” the need for mental health. Its like any other self care so do not feel guilty.
  
    I have heard that you are better off seeing them to help you search for a therapist off campus that is compatible with your goals. They aren’t able to see you for recurring sessions and sometimes thats what most people seek.

"

    Here’s my take:
  
    I would say clubs are not necessary to land a job and a recruiter probably wouldn’t think twice about you having a bunch of projects and work experience rather than clubs.
  
    With that being said, I would highly discourage just avoiding them altogether. Here are some reasons
  


    larger clubs will sometimes bring in sponsors for recruiting events, and in these cases the sponsors are coming specifically to recruit from your club essentially. This is a massive advantage over something like the career fair, where you are competing with hundreds of other interested people. I know the main club I am in has multiple sponsor events a semester and it’s very common for some club members to end up at those companies
  


    Clubs are a great starting place for many interview questions. You know, the common ones like “describe a time where you worked as a team” or “describe a time when something went wrong” etc. I found myself almost always referring back to a club experience for all of these questions
  


    Mental health. CMU can feel like a “grindy” school if all you do is just classwork. That’s sort of what I felt like my freshman year (Covid made it hard to really be in any clubs). But as soon as I started just scheduling clubs and activities into my day I was pretty amazed with just how much better I felt mentally but also with just how much time I actually had available. Those mental breaks are super important and I found let me work more productivity.
  


    My personal best experience has been roboclub. This isn’t an ad for roboclub, it’s just what I have experience with and I’m sure there’s other clubs with similar philosophies. The thing with roboclub is that it’s not any sort of big time commitment. It’s just a place you show up to work on random fun projects, get supplies for a project, or just do homework/talk. Some weeks I find myself there for like 6 hours a day to socialized/work because I’m not too busy, but some weeks I may barely go in. It’s just a stress free place to hang out and it only ever takes up as much time as you are able to put in.
  
    I’ll reiterate one thing just because it’s probably the biggest thing I got out of my undergrad here in terms of time management: Just put things on your calendar that you think are fun. I thought I had no time, and then my sophomore year ended up doing 4 clubs very actively and honestly felt so much better. I didn’t really feel that much more pressure with workload, it just helped me more efficiently use my time and not waste it being depressed.

You have no interest in actually understanding the nuance and just want to make wild and misleading claims.

    You are grossly misrepresenting the democrat's position.
  

    Open borders are a horrible idea. You are just letting in a bunch of central and southern American criminals (see the Venezuelan gangs in places like CO). No letting in millions of illegals every year and stopping them before they get in would be a good start.
  

    Democrats don't support open boarders or letting in criminals.  That just a lame exaggeration.  But until republicans chose to actually fix the issue instead of just campaigning on it, we can move forward with a sensible policy that lets in vetted people.

    Trump has no economic policy or vision besides some stupid notion that tariffs are somehow taxes on other countries and generate revenue from outside the US.
  
    The economy as a rule has done significantly better under democratic administrations vs republican for about 100 years.
  
    So take your bs elsewhere. Cost of living isn't nearly twice as high. Trumps tax policies hurt the middle class, which Reagan's policies effectively killed off anyways. Republicans are awful for the lower, working, and middle classes economically, and dismantle the social services that actually help to lift people out of poverty while actively working to sabotage any legislation that actually helps people, not corporations or private interest groups.

    There was one thing that helped me get past this stage of being a cmu student: force yourself to take a break. The only way for me to figure out that it was fine to do less was to do less and see that nothing went wrong. Play some video games, take a nap, get a sweet treat.
  


    First semester is definitely the hardest for cs. It will get easier.
  


    Ask for help in classes. These classes are not designed for us to just sit down and do the work. We’re supposed to think about it, ask for help, and make mistakes. A bad homework or even midterm grade is not a big deal, and it’s certainly not worth mental and emotional health.
  


    Ask for help in general. Caps exists because you’re not the only person that feels this way. Even if you don’t want regular therapy, you can make a one time appointment on the online platform and just talk things out with a local professional who you don’t ever have to see again.

    Allowing abortions beyond viability for fake health exceptions is not the main position of Harris, Biden or the Democratic Party.  They want to empower doctors do make the decision of whether the mother is in real danger.  While you may be able to find some doctor somewhere who is being too careless with this standard, that is something that should be questioned but not used as justification for overcorrecting on overall policy and heavily restricting abortion beyond what the electorate wants and has voted for in many state propositions.

    They can but it isn’t remotely feasible for poor mothers to do so.
  

    Many also still qualify for Medicaid under income  thresholds.
  

    Many republican states have a steep cliff where benefits drop to zero at around $20k for a mother with one child.  Thats a full time job earning $9.60 an hour.  If she earns ten dollars an hour they get no health insurance!  It basically makes woman completely screwed if the father walks out in  them because there is no way for them to work to buy their own insurance and afford child care.

    How many of you came to US with less in $3k in your pocket?
  

    I came to the US with less than $1k as an undergrad. However, important caveats: I had already paid for my first year of rent and the lowest tier of meal plan (yellow on [0], which is not designed to be enough food for most people). Additionally, I secured employment ASAP.
  
    Budget-wise, I mooched off free food from events. With my meal plan, I spent about $100 on food total in my first six months at CMU (doing a quick adjustment for inflation, that's closer to $150 today), and that was all ""luxury"" spending from my income. On supplementing income with on-campus employment:
  


    I secured an on-campus desk job before I arrived at CMU. At 7.75/hr, I got about $1.2k for that for the entire semester (not enough available hours).
  


    As a new teaching assistant (TA) at 11/hr, I only had enough hours to reach $1.4k for the semester.
  


    Later as a TA at 11.50/hr, I found a course that had more work to do and reached the full 20 hours, bringing it to $2.7k per semester.
  


    TA pay is department specific. TAs make a little more money nowadays, at least in the CS department. So you may be able to bump up these estimates by a few hundred.
  


    Unfortunately, the US immigration system is generally hostile and adversarial. Because you already know you're experiencing economic hardship, you are unlikely to qualify for working off campus [1]. However, CMU does have a food pantry [2]; you won't starve. In a pinch, there are showers on campus and quiet corners to fall asleep in. That said, you can probably still find low-quality housing situations (shared bedroom, rats as roommates, etc) at around $500 a month.
  
    Basically, do I think your finances are workable? The food situation should be fine (as long as you're not picky), the cost can be literally $0 (you just won't like life very much for a while). Health insurance is $2.7k. You can pay over time as I did, but that leaves you $300, so you need a job ASAP. The rent is iffy. In a pinch, you can be temporarily homeless on campus if you're not disruptive and lay low (e.g., only have  a backpack's worth of stuff and move around frequently), but you shouldn't count on that.
  

    Is this a huge financial risk?
  

    Yes. But if you are from an extremely low income country and CMU is offering fully paid tuition, this is also an opportunity of a lifetime. Even working ""crappy"" jobs in the US, you are likely to earn more in one month than your parents earn in one year (or more).
  
    That said, what program were you admitted into in the college of fine arts? What are you hoping to do after you graduate from CMU? Have a concrete plan. If you are also from a low-income situation, then be careful - a lot of the ""follow your dreams"" stuff may not apply to your situation.
  

    Should I wait for a better time..?
  

    What would a better time be? In one year from now, will anything about your financial situation change substantially?
  

    I would surely lose my 100% scholarship to CMU
  

    This may not be a surely. If a year makes a huge difference, beg. Send a short and polite email explaining your circumstances.

    The Green New Deal pushed by Democrats eliminated Nuclear…
  

    Most elected democrats had nothing to do with  the green new deal.  All that matters is what they passed in Congress which was a massive bailout to the overly expensive nuclear industry.  Solar and wind have been beating nuclear on price for a while now. But in general nobody wants to live near a nuclear power plant after three mile island which has made it more expensive and difficult to build.  But as far as democrats support for nuclear,  the are given bailouts to several shuttered plants and restarting them like three mile and palisades.  Obama gave large subsidies to a new nuclear plant in Georgia.  But at the end of the day it is very expensive, we don’t have a solution for the waste or the water pollution it causes so it’s not a cure all for clean air.

    How many of those states were controlled by Democrats for 100+ years?
  

    That has got to be the stupidest thing you have said.  Those states haven’t been controlled by democrats in over fifty years.  The party names of the past are meaningless and generally most of the policies have flipped between the parties in the 60s

    Says who?  There is a penalty if they don’t but it is usually cheaper to pay the penalty than provide insurance.  And it only applies to large employers with more than fifty employees.  Many just only hire part time people anyway. A mother can work fifty hours a week at two part time jobs earning $9 and hour and not qualify for any health insurance assistance
  

    Not to mention there are still free clinics,
  

    Those are a drop in the bucket compared to the need for services and provide very basic care.  Most of those are government funded so basically socialized healthcare and the brainchild of Bernie sanders who has singlehanded secured their funding year after year
  

    and every single hospital system has charity care when people who make less than 100%-200% of the poverty line pay little to nothing.
  

    Did you just pull that out of your butt or do you have sources?  Hospitals donate bare minimum care just to stabilize and then kick people out. They still bill these people for as much as they think can get without pushing them into bankruptcy which makes it harder to collect.

    What is your source on that?  Many countries in Europe have top rates over 50%.  Anyway, capital gains, carried interest and pass through income allow many rich people to avoid income tax in the U.S.  But regardless of how progressive the tax code is, that’s despite republicans efforts to get the rates lower.  And yet we still manage to fail at helping mothers.  We have some of the least health care access for mothers after birth, we have near zero after school and summer child care, no paid leave after birth, and the list goes on and on.  Good news is we have enough fighter jets and nuclear bombs to destroy the whole world.  Let’s get into how much of a failure and waste of money so many defense project are like the f22, f35, littoral combat ships. Look at those if you are wondering where all the tax money has gone.

Meanwhile you are upset that the government is trying to expand electric cars and clean up the air so we don’t have embarrassingly high levels of childhood asthma in poor neighborhoods.

    Again, Roe didn’t impose any restrictions.
  

    Again, it set the frame work for 24 week abortions.  Casey modified that with giving viability a stronger emphasis.  But after that decision, and a change in the composition of the court, the interpretation of undue burden became anything republicans don't like regardless of the burden it placed on pregnant woman.  So for 20 years roe was the standard, and Casey clarified the burden standard which was reasonably enforced until the 2010s. But then  states started creating dubious restrictions in a backdoor attempt to limit abortions before viability,
  

    The law passed after Dobbs banned a whole bunch of state level restrictions that were allowed under Roe/Casey. So it is not just about returning to what was allowed before. 
  

    Those state level restrictions were  poorly disguised attempts to skirt the viability framework.
  

    So what restrictions has Harris ever came out in support of?  I don’t see any statement of her supporting any restrictions.
  

    She has made it clear that she supports the viability standard and the judgement of doctors. Here is the restriction in the law passed after Dobbs:
  
    ""A prohibition on abortion after fetal viability when, in the good-faith medical judgment of the treating health care provider, continuation of the pregnancy would pose a risk to the pregnant patient’s life or health.""
  
    Thats a restriction: abortion is restricted by the physicians judgement and the regulation of physician's medical license which is usually at the state level. While that might open the door for lax enforcement of the health of the mother standard, it is left to the states medical licensing authorities and therefore state legislators to interpret and the courts to enforce.
  
     > 12-15 weeks seems to be the median point for banning abortion in the US (also in line with the rest of the world). 
  
    However most other countries have a lot of the exceptions you seem so worried about.  The majority  of the US public supports up to 24 weeks with some exceptions and 15 weeks with no exceptions.

    Basically it said that in any state they are allowed to perform an abortion if they deem the mother’s life or health at risk.
  

    It leaves to the states and the courts to decide what ""health of the mother""  means after the point of viability. That is what existed before and after Roe but before Dobbs.
  

    Not to mention this law passed the house but not the senate…
  

    I meant to say it would have passed the senate except for the filibuster which is the issue at hand and her position on that.

    Taxing unrealized gains is necessary when billionaires use loopholes like leveraging those gains with loans so they can spend the money without paying taxes
  

    Pretty much every economist agrees that taxing unrealized gains is a horribly ineffective and inefficient mode of taxation.
  

    Your definition of killing babies is very unpopular. Any time it has come up for a vote at the state level, pro-choice has won even in conservative states.
  

    Most people think that killing unborn babies after viability should be banned.  The bill Democrats supported and passed in the House would eliminate any effective state level restrictions after viability.
  
    Question for you, what abortion restriction does Harris support?
  

    The filibuster is undemocratic as is the overall design of the senate. It is a hold over from the House of Lords in England and does nothing but protect the elite and privileged.
  
    The filibuster is a key feature that prevents the Tyranny of the Majority.  You shouldn't be able to blow up the country because you won a slight majority.
  
    Hating the structure of the Senate just shows you don't understand the underlying structure of the country.
  

    Democrats don't support deportation because it is bad for the economy and causes pointless suffering.
  

    LOLOLOL.  Harris now says she supports deportation. Open borders are a horrible idea.  You are just letting in a bunch of central and southern American criminals (see the Venezuelan gangs in places like CO).  No letting in millions of illegals every year and stopping them before they get in would be a good start.
  

    If by hamstring Israel you mean enforce international law then yes
  

    What part of international law forces Israel to continue negotiating with terrorists like Sinwar while they abuse and murder hostages and just prolong overall suffering.
  
    You are probably the kind of person who believes the fake numbers that come out of the Hamas Ministry of Health.

    Again, Roe didn’t impose any restrictions. 
  
     The law passed after Dobbs banned a whole bunch of state level restrictions that were allowed under Roe/Casey. So it is not just about returning to what was allowed before.   
  
    So what restrictions has Harris ever came out in support of? I haven’t seen her support a ban with a health exception. A ban with a physical health exception. I parental notification law for minors. Admitting privileges for doctors. Literally any restrictions. Not one has she said she supports.
  
      I don’t see any statement of her supporting any restrictions.  12-15 weeks seems to be the median point for banning abortion in the US (also in line with the rest of the world).  
  
     What voters have shown is they prefer a law they view as too permissive than too restrictive.
