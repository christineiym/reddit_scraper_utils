ula,/user/Additional-Bus726/,UNC 2023,"For many of the ""weed out"" classes, the drain on students' mental health is clear. These classes try to squeeze too much material in a short amount of time. These classes usually are massive, making interactions with faculty harder and inaccessible. If students don't pass these weeder classes, this will mess up their entire college life, and possibly jeopardize their life plans. The anxiety definitely drives people insane.Then, there come other problems that further fuels stress, such as registration, financial problems (considering CH is extremely expensive), and so much more.This really boils down to how broken the UNC system is. Just adding peer tutoring, ULA, and sending out meaningless emails seems like a cheap way to ""pretend"" that the administration ""cares"" about its student. The whole structure of the school needs to change in order to make a meaningful change.On a side note, please take care of international students. International students fly to a completely different country with ZERO support. Everyday life is a struggle, and UNC, being this way, makes it impossible for international students to stay mentally sound. Add immigration complexities, life is much more miserable than students that call the US their home.",7 upvotes

ula,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"Hello! It is not that bad! Trust me! All the other commenters here are very correct and filled with insight. To be honest, I did not know that there was a change in the B school pre-reqs where ECON 410 is now a core into KFBS curriculum.First off, take 410 with MSA. MSA is one of the BEST professors here at UNC and it is all about the teaching structure she has. She is so organized and on pace, with efficient and effective use of time. She goes by the books and is very fair on her exams and deliverables. One big thing for that class is that she gives us HELP SHEETS which are very very good. They are essentially scaffolding that can help us better understand microeconomic theory as a tool. I feel that from a course perspective, 410 is easier than 101 because it is not as wide or encompassing in both macro and micro; instead, 410 is deep and that is a good thing. This is because in my opinion, you can focus DEEP and learn and find connections between consumer and firm theory. In fact, the class is divided into 3, which is consumer theory first, then some (oof kind of forgot a bit) involving risk premium and extensions to consumer theory, before diving into firm theory. There are CONNECTIONS and honestly, a MIRROR between the first and last, third, part of the class. This is because the concepts of differentiation (partial derivatives) and constrained optimization and comparative statics is held. What you see as an indifference curve here in the first third of the class becomes an isoquant in the last third of the class. These connections will allow you to do well.Another super important tip I can say is... do not avoid active learning and merely go for passive learning, aka just seeing MSA's great and short and to the point videos that are already on YouTube here . Instead, you need to compliment that with active working of questions in the Besanko textbook and to continue to practice the old exams and redo HomeWorks. Moreover, given that MSA is such a pedagogical teacher, she also notes the Bloom Taxonomy system to basically provide scaffolding and tease out essential concepts, both quantitative and qualitative (conceptual) for you. Altogether, pick up that pencil and continue to grind and churn out all sorts of practice questions. The more questions, the better, because it will condition you to do the free response part of the exam in under 10 minutes. Grind time, prime time! :DLastly, I want to say that the UNC Economics Department as a whole is always here to help, specifically through undergraduate learning assistants, peer tutors (undergraduates), and even the graduate TAs. Office hours, put simply, will be plenty. There will be a strong and well ordered ULA team of highly qualified undergraduates who often have more than 3 semesters of TAing experience. They will also be flexible on where they give office hours, including Zoom and at the Gardner Hall ECON AID Center (009). These ULAs have even been trained by MSA herself via her Seminar and subsequent practicum (ECON 291). Whenever you have a question, you can go to the help sessions in the EconAid center or those weekly solving sessions at the designated location as stated in the semester's syllabus. There are also Peer Tutors at the EconAid center who are paid by the department to assist you as well. Here is a calendarthat will be updated for the Fall with peer tutors (who teach more than 1 econ class). Remember, the ECON 410 ULA list will be posted in Sakai and the ULAs will introduce themselves too at the start of the course. You might see me at the EconAid Center haha! :DAll in all, add oil! You got this! Hwaiting! ECON is FUN and that there are many connections in business, especially when we dive more into IO and strategic economics. MSA is such a great professor and that she wants students to succeed. A lot of students I have met really like the class and MSA. It is a class that is grinding on having a strong math foundation for all that constrained optimization and that the models learned there like the lagrangian method and comparative statics is a foundation for many field and upper level elective courses.Do you have any interests in economics or in business? Hope to see you around too at McColl! :D",8 upvotes
ula,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"ECON 101 is a class that many students take, and it does not matter of a particular professor honestly. Here are some of my thoughts, and sorry for this late night rambling LOL. Just wanted to get some thoughts down. :DI took ECON 101 with Dr. Staub back as a freshman like you, and that I personally liked the course that was offered fully remote, and made me want to major in economics. I took that course Fall of 2020.Also, I want to give a disclaimer in that there are a bit of students who rate Dr. Staub on RMP not in a fair light, but I disagree with that and having served as a former Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for her ECON 101 course, in person, I think she is an awesome professor that will prepare you for the major.To start off, her style is the flipped classroom, which is just like Dr. Balaban's, where you read the textbook and prepare for class where we do challenge questions. This is a method that is great in my opinion, in that for these large sized courses, and intro econ, it is good to know the calculation and knowhow from multiple attempts and many exposure to a variety of problems. It also is a good method for many of the first year students to be exposed to one method of class and shape a study method that is based around groupwork. I firmly believe group work with a maximum of 3 students, all motivated by say, getting into the B-School or pursuing the economics major, will greatly help as you guys can talk the questions out and as Dr. MSA says, ""rectify your contradictions"" in that you find errors and compare problems, and hone by many question exposure. Active method is the key here, rather than say, passively reading the textbook or ""rewriting"" her video lecture notes. That is a big tip I can say for both ECON 101 and also ECON 410.Many students, even myself, ever since looking at reddit, know that ECON 101 is a weeder course, a hefty 4 credit hour course that many majors take, and bulk of them are B-School applicants. I came in as a POLI major, and we even had ECON 101 as a requirement (but now, it is removed). I feel this underscores a motive to keep on grinding ECON 101 in that it is a great survey course that is applicable to many fields, say for political economy or public policy to even business. Hence, That is one way to look at the course, not in an attainment goal perspective, but also intrinsically. Moreover, ECON 101 is a large class, of over 300 students (~475 back in Zoom day for me!) and that you will again find a great study group to grind the problem sets and practice problems that Dr. Staub provides. She gives all the resources and I can attest to that because I made some of the practice problems, as a ULA. Now, let's look at some of the many many good resources.Resources for ECON 101:The EconAid Center. I know I might be biased coming as a ULA, but this is a dedicated center for econ students to study and just grind on econ, and meet new friends and do group work. It is at the basement of Gardner hall. TAs hold office hours there, along with professors and ULAs and Peer Tutors. There are whiteboards and chalkboards that make active learning easy. Textbooks too. Use this space to bring your small group to grind out a problem set right after a lecture, so called ""strike the iron when it is hot."" Then, strategically wait for a ULA or TA office hour, and address any questions you have directly that same day. It will stick and you can learn other approaches and tips!****Dr. Staub gives a good amount of practice problems and actual midterms are released, which are helpful for the Final.End of chapter questions for the Krugman textbook is great, and she provides solutions as well.**TA review sessions. I really liked TA Roberto Mondragon, who led the ECON 101 test review sessions on Zoom. Very interactive. Lots of students attend and it is great to listen to all the questions and actively take notes.Office hours (any).Feel free to message me if you have any questions about ECON 101!

ula,/user/thepurplecat1/,UNC 2023,"Edit: spaces between paragraphsI’m actually taking both 116 (Carter) and 110 (Jordan).In 110, we have async lectures with practice questions on Tuesdays and in-class practice on Thursdays. Coding assignments are due about every week and you can very easily get help in office hours if you’re stuck. There are 4 quizzes (worth ~10% of your grade) and a final. There is more work in 110 than 116, but there is also a lot of support. The course has a small army of ULAs to help you in office hours. I have learned so much from 110 so far and even got to code a mini wordle program for one of our homeworks. As for the difficulty, if you do the work and do practice before quizzes, you’ll do fine. I believe the average for the first quiz was around an 80. Also if you turn in all your programming assignments early to get the 5% bonus, you can get Bs on the quizzes and still get an A in the class. Overall, because I have learned so much in 110 so far, I would recommend it to you as a good foundation for future classes involving coding or data science.In 116, we have in-class assignments/hw, a midterm and a final. Carter has said the midterm and final might be project-based. We've had two assignments to turn in so far. We have 1 TA (I think), so you usually have to wait in line to get coding help. I have heard that 116 has historically been challenging/frustrating for some people, but this has not been true with Carter. He brings very friendly, chill vibes to class. I will say the pace of the course is much slower than 110. I haven’t done the midterm yet but based on the HW difficulty, I think it’ll be pretty easy to do well. If your primary concern is your GPA, this would be the safest option. However, the course does not go into as much depth about how Python works. Also, it is less fun/engaging due to the slower pace.",1 upvote

MSA is a great teacher that has taught Micro Theory for a LONG time and the course delivery is so good. Sakai is well organized and she has so many help sheets if you need them to give the barebones and then always REINFORCE with the practice problems and TIME yourself for test preparation. For intro to metrics with Handy, I heard it is more difficult and an emphasis on the quantitative. Yet, having the calculus is good (saw improper integrals used for cdf/pdf) and stats background is good. BS in ECON is a good choice and you will have to keep at it with the quantitative side offered from the ECON department.If you ever need assistance, the UNC Department of Economics has the Peer Tutoring program in Gardner Hall 009.

The friends that I have made through joining clubs and being a ULA understand the struggles that we all go through as CS majors, and the spaces that I've been a part of are diverse and contain people who are supportive and truly want to see me succeed. Considering the fact that CS in general is not a diverse space and isn't full of people coming from different backgrounds, I would encourage you to try and get involved with the department outside of your classes if you haven't already. Some clubs that I would recommend checking out that I have had good experiences with are CS+Social Good, App Team Carolina, and the Enabling Technology Club. In terms of dealing with other CS students who aren't supportive of you and who look down on you, I would say don't let them get in the way of your love for CS.

ula,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"I definitely agree with u/RoundFriendship3 in that it is good to space it out! Firstly, do you have any AP exam or transfer credit for MATH 231 and STOR 155, which are AP Calc AB and AP Stats, respectively. Those are already 2/5 of the pre-reqs. Also, I feel emphasis is needed on the ECON sequence, which are ECON 101 and ECON 410. In fact, coming from a former ECON 101 ULA, we do have plenty of seats despite this class being in high demand for an introductory course. On Connect Carolina, I do see Dr. Staub's section, and she is a great professor. If you want to apply for Kenan-Flagler, I would do ECON 101 this coming Spring (Guaranteed, you will get it, plenty of seats) plus either BUSI 102 (a standalone, BUSI elective taught by CJ Skender). For BUSI 102, a 1.5 credit class, you can most likely email Skender and he might be add you. Then, maybe over the summer, get STAT and CALC done, either with a local community college for TR credit or at UNC summer school. Lastly, SAVE ECON 410 for the Spring of your Sophomore Year.

There were some days where I had 30 kids in office hours and my partner LA bailed because they freaked out at the amount of work we had, some days when students would contact me at 3 a.m. with questions due in the morning, some days when I stayed two or three hours past the end of my scheduled office hours to work with students, and some days where we each had to manually grade 200+ responses to multiple questions before the exam grade deadline and we had to pick up the slack because other people weren't available.It was an interesting and rewarding learning experience and I enjoyed getting to know students as I helped them learn, but it was also rough and exhausting (not to mention I did it on top of a 17 hour load).As someone who found out they aren't particularly enamored with teaching and didn't ask for the job, I second what was said above: only work as a ULA if you're truly passionate about the subject, and if you think you like teaching (and are willing to find out the hard way).

ula,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"Professor Kwaku is an awesome professor and he teaches ECON 420 very well, IMO, with his usage of the Froyen textbook as a firm backbone (get the book, gives you more practice questions!). Honestly, I agree with the facts of Tarheel4lifer24 on his point about exam preparation and going to his office hours. My biggest thing on workload is that his problem sets are rather quick to complete and can get repetitive between practice examples, HW, and ultimately, the midterm exams. For those short answers or computational questions, they are from the homeworks as he would put that same phrasing into his exams. I feel the exams are very standard, though, from my peer tutoring and ULA office hours, many students told me about his shift to multiple choice this semester for 420. I feel my biggest advice is to reference the Froyen textbook and be careful with the conceptual, such as ""crowding out,"" ""Planned investment,"" and the various schools of thoughts.

uta,/user/throwaway63788/,UNC 2023,"I think CS is actually getting better here, if you're willing to take a little risk.Previously, due to high demand, classes were so full there had to be a preregistration policy (everyone gets guaranteed 2 CS classes before anyone can get 3). I'm taking 4 COMP electives right now, and this enables me to graduate early and transfer some classes to the BS/MS program. So for me, it's been pretty good.In general, I think the CS education here is really good too. There are some Mickey Mouse classes, such as 426 (Martin) and 550 (Majikes, to a lesser extent) in which I didn't learn a ton, but you do get a lot out of most CS classes here. The faculty here are great at teaching (primarily, designing good learning environments through assignments, lecture slides, and rigorous tests. In general, lectures are shitty for learning, imo, but plenty of profs here are good lecturers too), and there are plenty of passionate TA's and UTA's as well.The only drawback is there's now an application process, and based on https://www.reddit.com/r/UNC/comments/zybpwp/computer_science_admission_results_out/ , the ratio is about 80% accepted.

I'm a UTA here and a self-employed tutor, and as hard as I try to convey ideas in simple ways (that have worked for me), I can't force my students to understand. Even when you understand because you've spent the time building up and reinforcing good mental models, you can't reinforce that model in their heads instantly. You can introduce that model to them and provide a ton of resources (which is why a lot of professors here post their slides and such), but learning is first and foremost a solo effort. You have to spend the time alone in your own head to learn. It's collaborative in that you have teachers and peers to guide you and show you better approaches to help you save some time and effort, but even if you had a 24/7 tutor, you'd still need to spend time alone (you would just tell the tutor to stfu so you can focus).Now, I haven't looked up the data on the effectiveness of a flipped learning model, but I hear they're pretty good. It just makes more sense - understand what you can before lecture, and find out the specific things you don't before class so that you can ask good and focused questions about those weaknesses during class. In an ideal world, this just makes sense. Maybe spend time covering new material (because you have to), but also provide time for questions (because if one person has a question, several have the same question) and practice (reinforcement of concepts).Add on the fact that students in each class are widely varied and professors have to teach to the lowest common denominator and that a lot of them have to do research as well... not looking too good for the traditional education model.Now for some brutal honesty. The primary purpose of being at UNC isn't to learn. If you wanted to learn in the most efficient way, you would stay at home (no commute, have access to free food and shelter if you happen to have loving parents) and watch MIT OCW courses. Their content is built different, and it's all for free and for everyone. Turns out that when professors are paid more, they develop higher quality material. Plus, and no offense to the professors lurking here (you all are great and underappreciated - I appreciate you), the professors at MIT are also built different. You would also want to do their assignments and assessments because they're more rigorous and allow you to develop a deeper understanding, same as what I mentioned above.But you wouldn't get certification for any of that.Let's be honest. We're at UNC because we need reputable certifications of our education (and friends, networking, etc.). Hypothetically, a professor's job could boil down to crafting detailed, accurate, precise, and rigorous assignments and tests so UNC knows we're deserving of their degrees. Ideally, professors could ignore the teaching part because the content is already out there - reinventing the wheel. But they have to teach and produce good lecture content because we won't just do that stuff on our own; they have to facilitate that, so that's still necessary. Of course, they also need to answer student questions live as well - we really need to ask more focused questions in lectures; questions are very important.One last thing, small shoutout to the professors here who spend a ton of time and effort making some of the best educational material there is. You're irreplaceable, and I wish everyone could access your content because it's valuable to society and just built different.",2 upvotes

uta,/user/KrisJordan/,Class of 2007 | CS Professor,"Yes, actually.The main limiting factor is ""instructional budget"" which is how TAs and UTAs are paid. Departments try to allocate this by number of students enrolled. Where it's tricky is the way this should work (directly proportional departmental budget each semester) isn't quite how it works in practice (budgets are mostly fixed before the academic year begins and get adjusted annually is my understanding, but this is a bit above my pay grade). So departments can't grow enrollments arbitrarily because it's important to have TAs and LAs that scale along with enrollment size.I'm planning to grow my section of Comp110 as long as I'm able to staff it with enough UTAs to properly support all the students enrolled. If there are particular large courses that are full that you are trying to get into, my advice is to wait for the official size guidelines to be decided on (latest thinking I've heard is around 50 students because distancing will need to be maintained in lecture) and reach out to the department's undergraduate director and ask if additional seats can/will be added since lecture will not be limited to seats in a classroom.",8 upvotes

undergraduate teaching assistant,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"Hello! It is not that bad! Trust me! All the other commenters here are very correct and filled with insight. To be honest, I did not know that there was a change in the B school pre-reqs where ECON 410 is now a core into KFBS curriculum.First off, take 410 with MSA. MSA is one of the BEST professors here at UNC and it is all about the teaching structure she has. She is so organized and on pace, with efficient and effective use of time. She goes by the books and is very fair on her exams and deliverables. One big thing for that class is that she gives us HELP SHEETS which are very very good. They are essentially scaffolding that can help us better understand microeconomic theory as a tool. I feel that from a course perspective, 410 is easier than 101 because it is not as wide or encompassing in both macro and micro; instead, 410 is deep and that is a good thing. This is because in my opinion, you can focus DEEP and learn and find connections between consumer and firm theory. In fact, the class is divided into 3, which is consumer theory first, then some (oof kind of forgot a bit) involving risk premium and extensions to consumer theory, before diving into firm theory. There are CONNECTIONS and honestly, a MIRROR between the first and last, third, part of the class. This is because the concepts of differentiation (partial derivatives) and constrained optimization and comparative statics is held. What you see as an indifference curve here in the first third of the class becomes an isoquant in the last third of the class. These connections will allow you to do well.Another super important tip I can say is... do not avoid active learning and merely go for passive learning, aka just seeing MSA's great and short and to the point videos that are already on YouTube here . Instead, you need to compliment that with active working of questions in the Besanko textbook and to continue to practice the old exams and redo HomeWorks. Moreover, given that MSA is such a pedagogical teacher, she also notes the Bloom Taxonomy system to basically provide scaffolding and tease out essential concepts, both quantitative and qualitative (conceptual) for you. Altogether, pick up that pencil and continue to grind and churn out all sorts of practice questions. The more questions, the better, because it will condition you to do the free response part of the exam in under 10 minutes. Grind time, prime time! :DLastly, I want to say that the UNC Economics Department as a whole is always here to help, specifically through undergraduate learning assistants, peer tutors (undergraduates), and even the graduate TAs. Office hours, put simply, will be plenty. There will be a strong and well ordered ULA team of highly qualified undergraduates who often have more than 3 semesters of TAing experience. They will also be flexible on where they give office hours, including Zoom and at the Gardner Hall ECON AID Center (009). These ULAs have even been trained by MSA herself via her Seminar and subsequent practicum (ECON 291). Whenever you have a question, you can go to the help sessions in the EconAid center or those weekly solving sessions at the designated location as stated in the semester's syllabus. There are also Peer Tutors at the EconAid center who are paid by the department to assist you as well. Here is a calendarthat will be updated for the Fall with peer tutors (who teach more than 1 econ class). Remember, the ECON 410 ULA list will be posted in Sakai and the ULAs will introduce themselves too at the start of the course. You might see me at the EconAid Center haha! :DAll in all, add oil! You got this! Hwaiting! ECON is FUN and that there are many connections in business, especially when we dive more into IO and strategic economics. MSA is such a great professor and that she wants students to succeed. A lot of students I have met really like the class and MSA. It is a class that is grinding on having a strong math foundation for all that constrained optimization and that the models learned there like the lagrangian method and comparative statics is a foundation for many field and upper level elective courses.Do you have any interests in economics or in business? Hope to see you around too at McColl! :D",8 upvotes
undergraduate teaching assistant,/user/sailor_rini/,Alum,"I'd be honestly very curious to hear from students why some think curriculum is so ridiculous here. It seems pretty standard from my experiences at other universities and even slightly easier than my undergrad.This might be field dependant though. I had really good experiences with language departments. For example, I had some good professors for flexibility when there was some type of issue (shoutout to the Russian department), and some good experiences with the stats major (flexibility when I got covid). I've also had bad  experiences in the math major and the stats major,  particularly for chronic (not acute like covid) illnesses. I have some heart/blood-related issues and I basically need assistance from parents to get around places  (to avoid falling on something and the resulting blunt force trauma), and so I reached out to some professors who more or less told me it sucks to suck and that I should withdraw and I didn't really feel heard. I've known several of my peers, from a whole range of ages, who have similar experiences (from 18 year old freshmen to back to school mid 30s). Many of us are transfers as well, and have different experiences and it's jarring coming here. I feel like this is different in languages or social sciences, but for some of the STEM subjects some of the instructors can be quite cold and mechanical in their responses, and not particularly sympathetic.  I have so much anxiety around being physically ill because from past experiences, I'm expected to basically just ""eat the loss"" with the classes/instructors I've taken.  I've also seen some policies in the beginning of the semester that my medically fragile father was deeply uncomfortable with due to the risk of covid/my bringing back covid or getting it since I myself am also medically fragile. These policies include not posting the notes in case class is missed/relying on other students, not having remote options, lack of flexibility in case someone has symptoms and should stay home . I've even seen some particularly egregious cases which mandatory attendance, and quite frankly, this is....not the time for that, as some of us really cannot afford being shoulder-to-shoulder with sick students who came to class, and getting sick ourselves in this pandemic world. I understand encouraging students to come to class, but I feel that health and safety is also important and there shouldn't be a penalty on people (students,as well as whole entire families and communities) for basically not being able-bodied enough.  Again, some departments very much do not do this (the Russian department again, does things correctly) but other departments are behind the times. With some departments as well, I'd say there is decent evidence of institutional ableism (not just for undergrads).Additionally:As someone in charge of grading and some teaching, this is the one place I could have influence, and honestly, if we curve exams anymore than we already are, we might as well just give out all As. And they are already open book, open note, and open talking to other studentsThe curved exams are way worse than the uncurved exams in maths---it's usually curved at the end so it can be difficult to tell where you stand (which can increase anxiety), and sometimes I feel like curving is over-relied upon and it basically becomes normalized to have harder-than-reasonable exams. Usually, students feel better when a curve is not announced ahead of time because that typically means the exam is more reasonable.Also my math exams have consistently been closed everything, still, even with the pandemic and of course after the fact.  Also this is kind of instructor-dependant as well, on top of being department-dependant. I've had a couple of wonderful, sympathetic instructors but it gets lost in a sea of instructors who are unsympathetic and do not hide their contempt about teaching undergraduate classes--because the one lovely instructor becomes a shining light in a sea of bad professors/the general culture is still bad even if the individual is good. I'd also add there are some systemic issues related to equity here but that could be its own post.Moreover,  I'd add that sometimes it's not even the curriculum for undergrads, but also for grad students as well as toxic PI's if you are doing research. I have a peer who's doing swimmingly in her grad school now doing engineering, after having a bad time with UNC undergrad (math/bio double major) and is headed for NASA. She had bad experiences with people she did lab work or research under and just honestly really toxic behavior.",6 upvotes

undergraduate learning assistant,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"ECON 101 is a class that many students take, and it does not matter of a particular professor honestly. Here are some of my thoughts, and sorry for this late night rambling LOL. Just wanted to get some thoughts down. :DI took ECON 101 with Dr. Staub back as a freshman like you, and that I personally liked the course that was offered fully remote, and made me want to major in economics. I took that course Fall of 2020.Also, I want to give a disclaimer in that there are a bit of students who rate Dr. Staub on RMP not in a fair light, but I disagree with that and having served as a former Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for her ECON 101 course, in person, I think she is an awesome professor that will prepare you for the major.To start off, her style is the flipped classroom, which is just like Dr. Balaban's, where you read the textbook and prepare for class where we do challenge questions. This is a method that is great in my opinion, in that for these large sized courses, and intro econ, it is good to know the calculation and knowhow from multiple attempts and many exposure to a variety of problems. It also is a good method for many of the first year students to be exposed to one method of class and shape a study method that is based around groupwork. I firmly believe group work with a maximum of 3 students, all motivated by say, getting into the B-School or pursuing the economics major, will greatly help as you guys can talk the questions out and as Dr. MSA says, ""rectify your contradictions"" in that you find errors and compare problems, and hone by many question exposure. Active method is the key here, rather than say, passively reading the textbook or ""rewriting"" her video lecture notes. That is a big tip I can say for both ECON 101 and also ECON 410.Many students, even myself, ever since looking at reddit, know that ECON 101 is a weeder course, a hefty 4 credit hour course that many majors take, and bulk of them are B-School applicants. I came in as a POLI major, and we even had ECON 101 as a requirement (but now, it is removed). I feel this underscores a motive to keep on grinding ECON 101 in that it is a great survey course that is applicable to many fields, say for political economy or public policy to even business. Hence, That is one way to look at the course, not in an attainment goal perspective, but also intrinsically. Moreover, ECON 101 is a large class, of over 300 students (~475 back in Zoom day for me!) and that you will again find a great study group to grind the problem sets and practice problems that Dr. Staub provides. She gives all the resources and I can attest to that because I made some of the practice problems, as a ULA. Now, let's look at some of the many many good resources.Resources for ECON 101:The EconAid Center. I know I might be biased coming as a ULA, but this is a dedicated center for econ students to study and just grind on econ, and meet new friends and do group work. It is at the basement of Gardner hall. TAs hold office hours there, along with professors and ULAs and Peer Tutors. There are whiteboards and chalkboards that make active learning easy. Textbooks too. Use this space to bring your small group to grind out a problem set right after a lecture, so called ""strike the iron when it is hot."" Then, strategically wait for a ULA or TA office hour, and address any questions you have directly that same day. It will stick and you can learn other approaches and tips!****Dr. Staub gives a good amount of practice problems and actual midterms are released, which are helpful for the Final.End of chapter questions for the Krugman textbook is great, and she provides solutions as well.**TA review sessions. I really liked TA Roberto Mondragon, who led the ECON 101 test review sessions on Zoom. Very interactive. Lots of students attend and it is great to listen to all the questions and actively take notes.Office hours (any).Feel free to message me if you have any questions about ECON 101!

undergraduate learning assistant,/user/ShortCircuity/,UNC 2023,"It sounds like you're planning to transfer no matter where you end up (assuming that you don't get accepted to the CS program), and from the tone of your post it doesn't sound like there are any limiting factors (i.e. prohibitive cost).If you don't think there's the possibility that you fall in love with one of your other choices and decide to stay there, then it can't hurt to spend a year at UNC if you've always wanted to go here - but I advise you to stop thinking of your other options as ""safeties"" now that you've gotten your acceptances, and now start thinking of them as legitimate choices. That'll make it a bit easier to be objective when considering what each school has to offer.Edit:If you do come here, it may be worth considering trying to place out of the prerequisite course for the major through the placement exam (or AP CSA if you took it) using the Comp 110 resources and lectures posted online; that way you can start the first major class (COMP210) as soon as possible (if they have admissions cycles by semester) and maybe reapply if they allow it?Or, do Comp 110 and/or Comp 283 your first semester and try to apply for an undergraduate learning assistant position for the course after your first semester to become more competitive in the application process (but those positions are highly sought after).And, no matter what, it is worth it to join at least one CS club like Carolina AR/VR (CARVR), App Team Carolina, CS for Social Good, etc.; that'll probably look good in the admissions process, and even if you don't get in, you have a good year of orgs to put on your professional resume for the duration of college (at least, I included college extracurriculars on mine).Good luck!",5 upvotes

I firmly believe group work with a maximum of 3 students, all motivated by say, getting into the B-School or pursuing the economics major, will greatly help as you guys can talk the questions out and as Dr. MSA says, ""rectify your contradictions"" in that you find errors and compare problems, and hone by many question exposure. Active method is the key here, rather than say, passively reading the textbook or ""rewriting"" her video lecture notes. That is a big tip I can say for both ECON 101 and also ECON 410.Many students, even myself, ever since looking at reddit, know that ECON 101 is a weeder course, a hefty 4 credit hour course that many majors take, and bulk of them are B-School applicants. I came in as a POLI major, and we even had ECON 101 as a requirement (but now, it is removed). I feel this underscores a motive to keep on grinding ECON 101 in that it is a great survey course that is applicable to many fields, say for political economy or public policy to even business. Hence, That is one way to look at the course, not in an attainment goal perspective, but also intrinsically. Moreover, ECON 101 is a large class, of over 300 students (~475 back in Zoom day for me!) and that you will again find a great study group to grind the problem sets and practice problems that Dr. Staub provides. She gives all the resources and I can attest to that because I made some of the practice problems, as a ULA.

I know I might be biased coming as a ULA, but this is a dedicated center for econ students to study and just grind on econ, and meet new friends and do group work. It is at the basement of Gardner hall. TAs hold office hours there, along with professors and ULAs and Peer Tutors. There are whiteboards and chalkboards that make active learning easy. Textbooks too. Use this space to bring your small group to grind out a problem set right after a lecture, so called ""strike the iron when it is hot."" Then, strategically wait for a ULA or TA office hour, and address any questions you have directly that same day. It will stick and you can learn other approaches and tips!****- Dr. Staub gives a good amount of practice problems and actual midterms are released, which are helpful for the Final.- End of chapter questions for the Krugman textbook is great, and she provides solutions as well.**- TA review sessions. I really liked TA Roberto Mondragon, who led the ECON 101 test review sessions on Zoom. Very interactive. Lots of students attend and it is great to listen to all the questions and actively take notes.- Office hours (any).Feel free to message me if you have any questions about ECON 101!

undergraduate learning assistant,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"I gave this response a week or so ago! It is for ECON 101 with Dr. Staub! :DECON 101 is a class that many students take, and it does not matter of a particular professor honestly. Here are some of my thoughts, and sorry for this late night rambling LOL. Just wanted to get some thoughts down. :DI took ECON 101 with Dr. Staub back as a freshman like you, and that I personally liked the course that was offered fully remote, and made me want to major in economics. I took that course Fall of 2020.Also, I want to give a disclaimer in that there are a bit of students who rate Dr. Staub on RMP not in a fair light, but I disagree with that and having served as a former Undergraduate Learning Assistant (ULA) for her ECON 101 course, in person, I think she is an awesome professor that will prepare you for the major.To start off, her style is the flipped classroom, which is just like Dr. Balaban's, where you read the textbook and prepare for class where we do challenge questions. This is a method that is great in my opinion, in that for these large sized courses, and intro econ, it is good to know the calculation and knowhow from multiple attempts and many exposure to a variety of problems.

undergraduate learning assistant,/user/juledos/,UNC 2020,"They’re already taught in the style, the problem is not so much physical space (although that is an issue), the problem is that it’s hard to scale a course up to teach more people without more teaching staff, which the department cannot afford (although it has a wonderful undergraduate learning assistant program). A lot of the overhead comes from the additional grading and need for office hours and such.Not my survey, so thank the OP! I just finished the program, but I hope for your sake and other future CS students that there is a resolution to this.",5 upvotes
undergraduate learning assistant,/user/quizbowlanthony/,UNC 2024,"Hello! It is not that bad! Trust me! All the other commenters here are very correct and filled with insight. To be honest, I did not know that there was a change in the B school pre-reqs where ECON 410 is now a core into KFBS curriculum.First off, take 410 with MSA. MSA is one of the BEST professors here at UNC and it is all about the teaching structure she has. She is so organized and on pace, with efficient and effective use of time. She goes by the books and is very fair on her exams and deliverables. One big thing for that class is that she gives us HELP SHEETS which are very very good. They are essentially scaffolding that can help us better understand microeconomic theory as a tool. I feel that from a course perspective, 410 is easier than 101 because it is not as wide or encompassing in both macro and micro; instead, 410 is deep and that is a good thing. This is because in my opinion, you can focus DEEP and learn and find connections between consumer and firm theory. In fact, the class is divided into 3, which is consumer theory first, then some (oof kind of forgot a bit) involving risk premium and extensions to consumer theory, before diving into firm theory. There are CONNECTIONS and honestly, a MIRROR between the first and last, third, part of the class. This is because the concepts of differentiation (partial derivatives) and constrained optimization and comparative statics is held. What you see as an indifference curve here in the first third of the class becomes an isoquant in the last third of the class. These connections will allow you to do well.Another super important tip I can say is... do not avoid active learning and merely go for passive learning, aka just seeing MSA's great and short and to the point videos that are already on YouTube here . Instead, you need to compliment that with active working of questions in the Besanko textbook and to continue to practice the old exams and redo HomeWorks. Moreover, given that MSA is such a pedagogical teacher, she also notes the Bloom Taxonomy system to basically provide scaffolding and tease out essential concepts, both quantitative and qualitative (conceptual) for you. Altogether, pick up that pencil and continue to grind and churn out all sorts of practice questions. The more questions, the better, because it will condition you to do the free response part of the exam in under 10 minutes. Grind time, prime time! :DLastly, I want to say that the UNC Economics Department as a whole is always here to help, specifically through undergraduate learning assistants, peer tutors (undergraduates), and even the graduate TAs. Office hours, put simply, will be plenty. There will be a strong and well ordered ULA team of highly qualified undergraduates who often have more than 3 semesters of TAing experience. They will also be flexible on where they give office hours, including Zoom and at the Gardner Hall ECON AID Center (009). These ULAs have even been trained by MSA herself via her Seminar and subsequent practicum (ECON 291). Whenever you have a question, you can go to the help sessions in the EconAid center or those weekly solving sessions at the designated location as stated in the semester's syllabus. There are also Peer Tutors at the EconAid center who are paid by the department to assist you as well. Here is a calendarthat will be updated for the Fall with peer tutors (who teach more than 1 econ class). Remember, the ECON 410 ULA list will be posted in Sakai and the ULAs will introduce themselves too at the start of the course. You might see me at the EconAid Center haha! :DAll in all, add oil! You got this! Hwaiting! ECON is FUN and that there are many connections in business, especially when we dive more into IO and strategic economics. MSA is such a great professor and that she wants students to succeed. A lot of students I have met really like the class and MSA. It is a class that is grinding on having a strong math foundation for all that constrained optimization and that the models learned there like the lagrangian method and comparative statics is a foundation for many field and upper level elective courses.Do you have any interests in economics or in business? Hope to see you around too at McColl! :D",8 upvotes

undergraduate learning assistant,/user/KrisJordan/,Class of 2007 | CS Professor,"My sister came to UNC and was here while I was in high school. She seemed happy here and I got to meet one of her friends who was studying computer science and learned more about the program then. I was impressed.I wanted to study Educational Technology as a PhD student and there weren't many programs that offered it. An acclaimed researcher at Brown University was doing research in this area with an emphasis on pen-based computing. Ultimately I think I found him at the wrong stage of his career, he was famous and not too actively engaged in the day-to-day of the research at the time. If I could do it again I would try to find a faculty member who had just recently received tenure, all else equal. Do not underestimate the importance of faculty relationship and you can trust your instincts when you meet potential PhD advisors about how it will shake out. Ultimately, I'm thankful for the experience because my advisor at Brown also taught their equivalent of COMP110 and he began their Undergraduate Teaching Assistant program there many years ago. The COMP110 UTA model is largely inspired by what I witnessed and was profoundly impressed by at Brown.",8 upvotes

If you’re planning on studying over the break and looking at the calendar, although it’s the first unit NMR is extremely easy and I wouldn’t spend much time on it over break. Instead, make sure you really understand the basics of carbonyls as much as possible. Also, really make sure you understand acid/base reactions and the principles of nucleoephility/electrophilicity. IMO, orgo is at base a logic class. You just need to know the rules.Go to office hours/peer mentor sessions. Do every single practice problem they give you. Do the book problems, too. It’s tedious as fuck, but it’s the best way to improve.Lastly, Rogue Chem. The professors don’t like to recommend it/talk about it. Get it. I never did the personal tutoring, but his practice problems are a godsend and are very similar to test questions. The one caveat is that if you’re in a class with Austell (he usually doesn’t teach orgo 2, though) you probably don’t need Rogue Chem because a) he writes his own exams so they don’t look like the standard chem format and b) the sheer volume of practice problems he will give you.Source: took I and II, got As in both",4 upvotes

peer mentor,/user/cassidym2/,UNC 2023,"For 202 Garland is a treat professor but the content can still be difficult at times. Recitation is a great time to ask questions as well as the peer mentor sessions. On her exams there tend to be a lot of “trick” questions (ie she puts something that sounds a lot like the definition of DNA but actually isn’t because of wording/technicalities) so having a grasp on definitions and understanding functions of stuff is super important.For orgo it’s practice problems. As many as you can get your hands on. When I took it they provided worksheets and the numbers of good practice problems in the book. You can go through class slides again trying to solve the problems on your own. Obviously start with you base understanding of the material but practice problems help root out specific things you don’t understand and then you can refer back to your notes and know what to focus on. For exams start studying AT LEAST a week before the exam. I personally made a schedule and said “Monday I’ll review lessons 1-2, etc” and then focused on practice problems and reviewing what I’m confused on in the days right before the test. Peer mentors can be a good resource and review sessions are another great way to get more practice problems. Also if you’re confused on a certain, spend time on figuring it out asap, because once you fall behind it’ll be hell trying to catch back up.It’s not gonna be easy but if you prioritize managing your time and blocking out time for school versus time for yourself, you’ll be okay.

I redid the problems from the slides and the Peer Mentor worksheets, which were insanely helpful too. Make flash cards for things that can be flashcarded.

The major is easily droppable, so there’s really nothing to lose.I picked EHS over biology bc I wanted a smaller community than the thousands of students in the biology department. There are ~30 students in my incoming EHS class, which means we get a lot of individualized attention at one of the best public health schools in the nation. As a pre-med applicant, I wanted something rather unique and was applicable in the real world if i decided not to go to medical school. Research opportunities in EHS are relatively plentiful since they’re are more grad students compared to undergrads here. There’s a variety of fields for research.I’ll be taking ~17 credit hours on average for the rest of my time here, but 2 of those are because I am a peer mentor in general chemistry. I will be taking summer classes this summer on a study abroad for my minor and next summer to finish up my gen eds.There’s one EHS advisor, Jennifer Moore (i think that’s her name), so if you have specific questions about the program or planning a potential timeline, I would reach out to her and she’d be happy to meet with you.Since you mentioned your interests, I think a minor in Health and Society would fit them really well.

peer mentor,/user/CheddarStar/,UNC 2023,"Im a Peer Mentor for 252, so I feel slightly more qualified to answer this.Specifically, 252 (the 3 credit hr class) covers pretty much **physiology** only. Topics included are the brain, nerve signals and nervous systems, bone formation, cardiovascular and respiratory systems, digestive system, urinary and reproductive systems. Seem like a lot? It pretty much is. While the INDIVIDUAL topics aren't difficult, its a lot of info to take in.More importantly, bio classes at UNC (and probably at a college level in general) are a lot more about conceptual understanding more than just basic memorization. You might think that makes it easier, but you need to understand how different topics fit together and how everything affects everything else. Applying what you know to new situations. The interplay between subtle concepts. A LOT of new students struggle with that transition between high school bio and undergrad bio. If you aren't confident in that, I don't think 252 is the place to start252 also assumes that you have a solid understanding of basic bio concepts. Basic anatomy of cells. DNA (to a lesser extent though). Cell differentiation + specialization. Epithelial cells (somewhat). If you're going in completely blind, then it'll be really tough.So my recommendation? If you took AP bio in high school and are really confident in your biology, then you could take 252. (A lot of people would probably tell you to not take it, but I believe the course is a lot more manageable than most think if you study well, properly focus, and have a good plan). If you're not confident in your high school biology, probably don't take 252. If this is your first bio class at UNC, probably don't take 252 unless you're REALLY excited about the material or know how to think critically at a college level.I would recommend taking biol 202 and/or 205, as some stuff you learn there is related to 252. (personally, I have AP bio credit. So I skipped 101. Started with 202, went on to 205 then took 252).252L is strictly anatomy. Its probably the most unfair lab you'll take at UNC. A HUGE amount of memorization and the ""quizzes"" (more like midterms) are quite brutal. Unless you have a lot of time to spare, its not a good idea to take 252 (but you should take 252 and the lab together, its much harder if you take it separately).Sorry for the ramble :)",5 upvotes

peer mentor,/user/poppyseed008/,Mod | Graduate Student,"Hi! I transferred from a CC last year with a decent GPA (not a 4.0 though, lol, so take my experience with that in mind). Everyone will tell you that your first semester at UNC is going to be a massive adjustment, and if you're like me, you're going to be tempted to brush those warnings off. I was confident in my writing and study skills - after all, I had done really well in my STEM classes, and I felt that they were at high difficulty levels. Here are the biggest barriers I faced when I adjusted to UNC; I hope that by sharing them with you, your adjustment will be much smoother than mine was.I had absolutely no study schedule. You're probably different from me on that - I hope you are. I would just study when I felt like it, keeping track of due dates and just making sure I got everything in on time. When exams came around I would start studying two or three days before the exam, cram a bunch of info in my head, do well on the exam, and promptly forget everything I had memorized after test day. This did not work at UNC. Like, at all. Please don't do that. I've had to start setting up study schedules - When am I going to study for this exam? I need to start at least a week in advance. What am I going to study on each day? How am I going to study: practice exams, practice problems, reviewing slides? For how long am I going study? The exams at UNC are vastly different and more difficult than anything I encountered at my CC.I didn't go to the ""optional"" stuff. Optional recitation sessions, peer mentor sessions, exam review sessions, Q&A sessions - I see all of these as mandatory for myself, especially now that I'm doing online classes. Sessions with my professors are especially valuable to me, because they're the most likely to adequately prepare you for exam level questions.I freaked out during my first exam. Like I said, the problems were tremendously more difficult than anything I had been previously exposed to. So I just rushed through them so I could get out of that damn lecture hall as fast as possible. When I went back and reviewed the solutions, I realized that if I had just taken a breath and relaxed, coaching myself through the problems, I would have done better. Now, when I take an exam and run across a question that freaks me out, I have a process. What, specifically, is this question asking for? What do I know that's given to me in the problem? What do I know from memory or through analysis? What do I need to find out? Then breathe. Then start trying to figure out how to get to the answer. On my second exam, I used this process, and scored two letter grades above my first exam. Relax.I didn't have a sleep schedule. I still kind of don't, lol, but I've gotten a lot better. I was doing this thing where I would sleep until like noon, then get up and work until like 3am. Which worked fine until I had to get up in the morning for my 8am. I was losing that time in the morning and making up for it at night. It legit took me six months to realize if I just did stuff in the morning, I could sleep at night. And I found I was SO much less stressed after 7-9 hours of sleep.Again, these are just the aspects of my personal learning curve I thought I'd share with you. Take what you like from this and what you think applies to you. Good luck with your application!",7 upvotes
