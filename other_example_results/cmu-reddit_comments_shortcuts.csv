    Can't speak much for the schedule itself; you can check the hours per week on cmucourses.com / the FCEs website / the discords. ~45 might be good for ur first semester but idrk.
  
    Unless one of the classes is in Mellon Institute, you have some relevant physical diability, and/or the professor regularly finishes class late, 10 minutes is enough time. It's the default amount of passing time between any adjacent classes. Tepper to Posner (~opposite corners of campus) is an 8min walk according to google maps (and you can see room locations in SIO)
  
    Edit: you can also email your advisor about these sorts of questions

    On maps Mcgill is pretty far from Tepper. Is the method to bike it? e-scooter
  


    not that deep; its like max 10 min walk, just save the money and get some cardio in. gets a bit annoying in the winter, but its whatever. everyone also kinda laughs at the people with escooters, tbh.
  
    2. Courses. how does this look for the fall and i haven't done my spring ones yet. I was also thinking about taking 70-207 (on that, 70-207 or 36-200?) because it looks interesting.
  
    looks fine. dont take the tepper (70-) stat or math classes, i heard theyre just annoying cuz they try to add a ""business"" as pect to it but its just more unnecssary work that doesnt teach you anything.
  
    3. what can I skip with my qualifying aps? Stats, CSP, Calc AB, Human Geo, Music Theory. specifically the first 3. do some clubs look at aps?
  
    nobdoy gives a flying fuck about aps sat or hs gpa. aps are truly just to give you credit; on stellic and wiht advisors, theyll tell you which aps give you credit for what requirements, and youll figure that out. no need to worry abt this rn. (but to answer your question, stats lets you skip 36200, 4 or 5 in CSA lets you skip 15110 or 112 (although not recommended if you dk how to code), 5 in ab/bc lets you skip calc1 and 2. theres a ap credits chart online for cmu specifically search it up)
  
    4. I've heard cmu recently made 99-101 so that you can't take it over the summer. will this affect my workload much?
  
    bro what?? c@cm has been a thing for like ever; make sure to do it over the summer cuz its just some simple modules and a common sense final exam. during the school year you have mandatory attendence classes once a week and pretty tough final exam so its just annoying.
  
    4. double major. Business Admin and statML double major seems very appealing to me but I don't know at all how it will change my path, workload, opportunities, etc. any advice? should i commit to a double major as early as possible? should i take 21-127 because its a prereq to a lot of courses that I may end up liking?
  
    just keep your courses as is. when you come youll meet upperclassmen and can ask them a bunch of stuff, so dw about this rn. either way, for basically any major first year is just prereqs and you strat your core classes in siphomore year so you have a whole year to figure things out. ik peoople who declare as late as junior spring so no rush
  
    5. i definitely sound overambitious but dual degree vs double major? on that, if I wanted to do a DM/DD would I have to submit another app for it? or maybe only for some like cs bc cmu is goated
  
    uh cs double is not easy lol dont talk it down; every business freshmen comes in wanting to do it and cant even handle the ""skippable ap csa"" class (15112) and just end up sounding stupid. again, dont worry about doubles or additionals or anything youll figure it later
  
    6. genuinely, truly, actually, what is the workload like. like yes our heart is in the work but im talking on a day to day basis if I was just doing a bsba.
  
    stfu you sound cringe talking about heart is in the work and all that. its just a clowned apon thing. workload? its tiring if you try/care. most people here are like 9am classes grind til 1am, with classes, internship/club applications, club work, projects, hanging out with friends, homework, etc. if you want to be succesful, be prepared to work ur ass off. cmu hhas good resources but only for those who care to take advantage. this doesnt mean you have to be antisocial and depressed tho; ik people who mained 4.0s as cs majors and went to bars and frats every thursday-saturday night. just a matter of what you can handle and enjoy.
  
    7. any underground tips you only learnt when you began to live at cmu for a while that would have helped had you known them earlier?
  
    youll learn them when youre here :)
  
    8. What does being a student at CMU get you in the city of pittsburgh? discounts, hacks, etc.
  
    student senate actually has some cool stuff. free musuem access, free pittsburgh train access (gets you basically anywehre in pittsburhg with 10 mins of walking to and from stops), free news station accounts (nyt games!, wsj, forbes, etc.), and then some like occasional student discounts for city team games, popups, and etc. youll see the ones that matter to you pop up on newsletters flyers around campus or emails
  
    9. literally anything else
  
    chill tf out. dont be weird and bugging people so much on linkedin or instagram; youll be judged when people meet you on campus for the first time. just chill, do basic research, but be ready to network hella and ask upperclassmen for lots of advice. youll be fine. 90% of the stuff i tried to gather about cmu before coming was like either wrong or turned out to be useless lol.

    For the late night bus there will probbaly be other students and theres no safety concerns.
  
    Any racism or weird shit that happens is in like New york or san fransisco. Pittsburgh is basically a suburb even downtown. Even the ‘sus’ people arent bad they just mind their own business.
  
    Ive taken the bus everytime, early morning, late night, etc and my biggest concern is always wheter it comes on time.
  
    Just look on transit or maps ahead of time and usually theyll be here around that time
  
    CMU campus is actually like a suburb. No issues here

    Look at a google map.  The campus is small and you wont’ need to take a bus or shuttle to get from dorms to campus, just walk across the street and you’re there.  Mudge is a block away but all the others are literally “on campus”.  If you’re asking about taking bus to other places off campus, yes, all of them are by a bus stop - block away max, depending on where you’re trying to go

    My son just got admitted to an MS in Computer Science at CMU.
  

    Congratulations to your son!
  

    Trying to scout out some information on housing for him for the fall. I also had a question about which building most of his classes might be in. On Google maps there is one building called ""CMU Computer Science Department"" and another called ""Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science"" at 5000 Forbes Ave. They are shown as near each other, but not the same. Can anyone tell me what the difference is, or would he be likely to have classes in both?
  

    Class location should not factor into housing decisions IMO. The campus is small, and he can get between the buildings that his courses will likely be in (i.e., Gates, Wean, Doherty) in 5 minutes.
  
    IMO, prioritize access to campus via public transportation and access to grocery stores.
  
    Most students live in Squirrel Hill or Shadyside. I prefer living further out in neighborhoods like East Liberty or Highland Park because they're closer to Target, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods (we just lost our Giant Eagle) and still have easy access to campus via 71A/B/C bus lines. To be totally honest, most days I do the 35-minute walk each way to and from campus. The exercise is good for me, it gives me time to catch up with family, and I enjoy seeing the neighborhoods.

    ScottyLabs recently tried making a map app that helps you navigate campus. In general it’s a tedious task and basically no one (including me, who was part of the team supposed to do it) was willing to put in the work. There were lots of blockers and the task is not very fun, so I don’t blame anyone. One blocker was CMU itself. Our original plan involved using Bluetooth beacons to triangulate your position inside a building. I think these beacons already exist, but we weren’t allowed to do that because of “security issues”. IIRC, there was another security issue in using the detailed floor plans which you have to sign in to get from FMS. A few years ago another guy made an android app that created a graph of all the rooms and buildings on campus by manually walking through each building and writing down the order of rooms and how long it took to get there. We were able to extract the graph from the app into a human readable format. I think it’s slightly outdated, but in theory you could easily run pathfinding algorithms on it to find your way around/shortest path.
  
    I think part of the problem is that you can easily learn what the best way around is in a few weeks, so the use case of this app is very narrow.

    BCSA/Design '21 alum here. Here are my notes on Doherty
  


    I had a couple classes in Doherty during my time at CMU and OH MY GOD it was impossible to find your room on the first day of classes. The building is laid out so illogically (which makes it kind of charming, but still a pain in the ass).
  


    Most of the upper levels are split and completely unconnected in the middle, save for that one level (floor 2 or 3, I don't remember) they just stuck a covered bridge in. It's honestly one of the funniest architectural features on campus to me.
  


    A pretty decent section of the basement levels of the building belong to the School of Art and it's this amazing case study on how artists occupy space in the same building differently from other academics. You can tell once you're in one of the art sections of the building. (Also, Art's digital print studio is in Doherty and it's totally worth trying to finagle your way into if you want access to some tools Design doesn't have).
  


    If you go to the backside of the building (the side that faces Gates), there's a staircase that runs the entire height of the building and has windows on three sides the whole way up.
  


    At the bottom level, under the stairs, is a tiny closet, literally a hole in the wall, that the art students sometimes reserve to do installation pieces in. It's an absolutely bizarro thing to discover in the middle of the night when you're lost in Doherty.
  


    At the top of that staircase is a door to access the roof closed with a padlock. If you're lucky it might be unlocked (though it probably won't be so don't get your hopes up).
  




    The floors in Wean and Doherty are fairly misaligned. This becomes apparent in the elevator between the two and in that liminal space where the two buildings blend into each other.
  


    There is a teeny-tiny museum of scientific instruments on level 1 (I think). I don't think anybody pays attention to it but it's a fun detail.
  


    This is going to be somewhat useless because I don't totally remember where it is, but near one of the elevators on the art levels of Doherty is a fairly useful map of what's going on in each floor of the building. I don't remember whether it's the whole building or just the lower levels, but regardless, it's helpful if you're trying to figure out the maze that is the building.
  


    Like all the Hornbostel buildings [ie the original ones] on campus, if you look up at where the roof meets the exterior walls, there's ceramic detailing that's unique to the building. Once you start paying attention to it, it's a gorgeous little detail of the original campus.
  


    I think I did the same project you're doing now when I was at CMU. Honestly I had a lot of fun just trying to figure out the madness of that building

    Do you at least have a general idea of where you might live? Each cardinal direction around Pittsburgh has a wildly different commuting profile. Parking is expensive, but that is the reality of an urban campus. Weekend parking on campus is free 5pm Friday until 6am (IIRC) Monday extended for campus holidays.
  
    As you might imagine, there are ways to park nearby that are free, at least at certain times of the day. Generally speaking, street permit parking in many residential neighborhoods is restricted to evening and overnight to allow residents to park. You can street park in these neighborhoods and hop on the bus to get to campus. I know people who park in Sq Hill, a few blocks or so off Forbes, and take a 61. I don't know exact spots, and good luck finding someone who'll let you in on theirs!
  
    If it were me, however, I'd rather not do this and instead live somewhere with accessible bus service to the campus area. Take a look at the system map for the Port Authority and you'll find there are a lot of direct buses to the area around campus that serve a large number of neighborhoods. For park and ride options, look at the P3 East Busway-Oakland if you're living in the eastern burbs.

    I could see a potential in a social aspect- sharing cut throughs or routes that optimize other factors- slope,  crowdedness, indoors vs outdoors? As a masters student in an interdisciplinary program im finding myself constantly traversing back and forth across different sections of campus in a way that isnt quite falling into a specific routine.
  
    Its true though that after a little time routes are figured out naturally and a map ceases to be as useful but i guess i’m more interested in it as an interesting data source/ widget rather than an app i’d need user retention on?

    WRT asking for applications to be added to vAndrew/Computer Lab machines:
  


    There is a formal process open to requests from Faculty (see here)
  


    Software licensing for large pools of machines can be costly and everything (even most free/open-source apps) need to be run through the license or contract review process.
  


    There is a timeline for when and how quickly applications that have passed licensing review/availability can be rolled out to labs (see link above)
  


    WRT storage options both Virtual Andrew and the physical Windows computer labs have the same configuration (see here):
  


    For persistent storage, things like your Desktop and Documents are mapped to folders in your 2GB MyFiles network storage space.
  


    Cloud storage like Box or Google Drive provides a bit of flexibility for smaller files.
  


    For temporary file editing/swap space, each Virtual Andrew or computer lab machine has a 'Sandbox' space that gets wiped on logoff so at least your 'scratch' disk isn't limited to 2GB.
  


    If you frequently interact with a large amount of data or need to work with large individual files it might make more sense to have a desktop on campus that you can access over the network or an external hard drive to bring with you to physical labs. (I used my desktop as a NAS when I was a student years ago and it was super handy, though you become additionally responsible for ensuring your own data backups ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ )

    I lived in Polish Hill for a year and Squirrel Hill for a year. I bought a used bike and biked daily to campus, all-weather (including rain and snow, you can clean off and change on campus). I think it is worth getting a bike if you're living off campus and don't plan on getting a car; it opens up the range of places that you can go to significantly (e.g., have biked to Costco, Pittsburgh Paintball Park, though those are outliers).
  
    Some thoughts:
  


    BikePGH has a bike map [0] that shows what roads are good to bike on. Figure out how to get to campus from your place.
  


    I personally don't think the bike sharing program is worth it, but ymmv. Never used it, just wasn't a fan of the pricing.
  


    Find safe spots to park your bike. Campus is generally safe. Once I forgot my bike lock and just left it unlocked on the bike rack on Gates 5 where there are cameras watching, nothing happened.
  


    Buses can be a little unreliable (especially if you're not on the 61 line, it can add up to 1h travel time), which is why I prefer biking. But most buses have bike parking in front of the bus, so if you're sick or the weather is bad or your lights are out etc, you can just take the bus.
  


    On that note, you only need a good bike light to be road legal here. Helmet strongly encouraged though.
  


    Pittsburgh drivers can be a little aggressive and/or dumb. A housemate got spooked in traffic by a car coming up to them and yelling, and I've come pretty close to being clipped by passing buses before. If there's nobody around (e.g., now, COVID times), consider biking slowly on the sidewalk instead until you're confident about biking on the road. Also don't be afraid to claim the road when it is legal to do so. Usually bikers here will claim the road and let cars pass whenever it is safe.
  


    Because the above might sound too scary, when I started biking here again I hadn't biked for at least 10 years prior and couldn't bike reliably around the block. I biked back slowly from South Side mostly on empty sidewalks to CMU and made it back in one piece. It isn't so bad once you get used to it, just pay attention to the road.
  


    The only time I would say you should not bike is the first day after a snow, before they've managed to really salt the roads. Too much barely-visible ice and an extra level of wackiness to drivers. Bike with extreme caution on days like that.
  


    Feel free to ask more questions! I haven't biked (or moved at all much) since the pandemic started, happy to suggest routes or socially distanced bike-around with you for a bit in the Fall if you're also vaccinated by then.

    Shadyside/Squirrel Hill are pretty common places for grad students to live. The surrounding areas can be good too, but it depends on what you’re looking for and what budget you have. I would look at the bus routes and try to live near one that goes down Forbes or Fifth Ave. Also check the CMU shuttle route maps, as living near it was a life saver when I was regularly going to campus. I live in Shadyside and can also walk ~30 min to campus. It’s easy to bike, too.
  
    If you’re looking for a lease starting in August, I think this is a great time to start looking. Generally, I think looking 2-3 months in advance is perfectly fine.
  
    As far as where to look, I think Zillow/Realtor/Apartments.com/Craigslist are all fine. I look at the apartments, then see if it’s through a management company, then go directly to that management company’s site to contact. If only a phone number is on the listing, if you Google the number you can often find the management company.
  
    Hope that helps!
  
    Edit: also, search in r/pittsburgh as there are apartment questions asked there pretty often

    Proper Brick Oven and Tap Room: Great pizza. Great bacon candy. It's a nice sit-down sort of place and a little on the pricier side, but I think it's worth it. Try the Bianca!
  


    Smoke: Barbecue tacos and great chips & queso. I like the rib tacos, personally.
  


    Condado: More tacos, this time Tex-Mex-ish. Love the tequila lime steak.
  


    Union Grill: Close to campus, and the french onion soup burger is my go-to. Failing that, the fish tacos are pretty decent.
  


    Chaya: Best Japanese place in town. As someone already said, it is a little expensive, but also worth it.
  


    Noodlehead: Thai noodles, cheap, delicious, but frequently crowded.

    CMU is a pretty liberal campus that is generally accepting, or at least tolerating. It’s not a center of LGBTQ+ social life and activism, but it has some resources and community. The health insurance covers most trans care, and the university’s health services also has great resources. There’s a pretty active undergrad LGBTQ+ club that also hosts a weekly affinity group for transgender and non-binary students. The Center for Diversity and Inclusion has recently begun to make efforts to include Trans-related programming.
  
    Of course, it’s not perfect. I’ve heard two major complaints. Navigating the bureaucracy around transitioning can be difficult if you begin the process while enrolled at cmu (mostly the name-change process). And I’ve heard that a significant number of the all-gender restrooms listed on campus maps are actually in restricted access areas, and the accessible ones are too sparsely distributed to be convenient (please feel free to correct me if that has changed, though). However, I suspect that you will be pleasantly surprised by CMU after living in the south.

    Honestly it depends what part of Robotics you want to transition to. Either way taking Robotics classes from the Robotics department is much better than taking classes in the MechE department. If you’re looking to get into more “Mechanical Design” part of robotics, then of course - Masters in MechE is better. But anything else - be it Controls, Perception or Navigation you are much better taking courses from the Robotics Institute. The courses were very very hands-on. Everything is implementation oriented. I actually did some research, as a Master’s student it’s hard to do RA for pay, most professors offer RA for credit. It maybe different if you are in the Research Master’s program (especially in SCS / RI, I hear most folks get RA-ships.)
  
    Again, unless if you have a strong motivation for MS in MechE you should go for MS in Robotics. Frankly speaking almost everyone I know from MechE was scrambling to take coursework from SCS / RI and work with professors from that department.

    I wasn't in TS, but I'm friends with a bunch who are/were. The community aspect is really the biggest thing. A lot of CMU students come from pretty privileged backgrounds and may not necessarily relate to your experiences, so TS gives you an additional community to fall back on. Some people make that their main friend group, others pop in sometimes, and others don't participate at all after the first event, it's all up to you. There are a lot of social events, special career/academic supports (i.e., tutoring by older scholars who have taken the class you're in), the TS lounge is nice (there's usually free snacks in there) and formal/informal mentorship from older scholars. Most of the events are put on by older scholars who are paid by the program to do so, so that can be a nice opportunity on both sides.
  
    There are dedicated staff members to oversee the program, who are available to connect you with any other resource throughout the university that you might need. So, for instance, if your laptop breaks and you're having trouble figuring out what to do, they'll help you get a loaner and connect you with the appropriate person to get it replaced (the university has financial assistance for this, but the process can be difficult to navigate without that extra help). Admin like the dean of students and university president also like to hear from TS student leaders about any ways that the university can better support you, so it can be a nice avenue to get your voice heard, too.
  
    The early move-in gives you time to meet others in the program and get introduced to the various resources available to you before everyone else moves in. I'd recommend doing it, but if you have a time conflict or something, I'm sure it's not required.

    First: relax.
  
    Second: if you’re intent on working your first summer, not doing academic research, or studying abroad, put in a few hours a week (3-5 hours max) into researching what you want to intern in and what would be required.
  


    resume + cover letter (get it reviewed!)
  


    find mentors (people in your life, and if not, there’s plenty of free mentorship programs like ADPList with people who are 10-15 years down the line in life who would love to walk you through their career experience and help you navigate early career stuff)
  


    some technical knowledge: you’d honestly be better off doing a few exercises (Leetcode), and focusing on how you approach these problems  (bare minimum is commenting on code, but having a process to hypothesize, test, and execute an approach will help and frustrate you less—a lot of cs is failing and figuring out how to navigate it)
  


    practice interviews: not only tackling a technical problem, but explaining it to someone in a way they can understand and contribute to the process is sadly rare

    A math degree from CMU can be incredibly rewarding if you navigate properly. A lot of the same quant firms that hire top tier CS students also hire top tier math students with a decent programming background, something you can develop at CMU. I would talk to your academic advisor about the career prospects of a math degree so you can start to plan your college path accordingly. Don’t be too stressed about it though, most people change their minds during college anyway; what’s most important is that whatever you choose to do, make sure it aligns at least somewhat with what you’re passionate about just so you can stick through it.

    Campus vibe is very work focused, there's a pressure to always be doing something amongst you and your peers. Not saying that there ain't time/room for fun and extracurriculars but there's an ambient vibe to do something beyond just your classes. As a grad student I'd imagine you'll have more focus on research towards your PhD and put a good amount of time into that, lectures, and maybe TA work that would be expected of you.
  
    Professors are approachable and very open to research opportunities and collaboration. As an undergrad I'd talk to professors about research they're doing or Small Undergraduate Research Fund (SURF) Grants without any real apprehension, so long as the work/idea sounded solid. Even did some grad research courses as an undergrad there just because I signed up for the class; CMU I found is very willing to enable people to try some new stuff if they make a solid enough proposal around it.
  
    Regarding life as a grad student was a bit weird for me since I did undergraduate there so a lot of my friends in the years below me were around so I wasn't as much a fish out of water as most of the grad students joining with me. I navigated both the grad and older undergrad circles and from what I've observed most of the grad students tended to keep to their circles, not really exploring much of campus life outside of the work tied to the PhD. Given the workload, the age gap, and the time needed to warm up to some stuff on campus I don't fault most of them for not jumping into these campus activities. It's not unheard of to have grad students do things like S'n'S, Buggy, or Dancer's Symposium (I once knew a girl who did Buggy for 8 years) but it's not the norm. Most grad students I've met during my MS were ones I met during classes, projects, or the happy hours the department would throw every few weeks or so, knock a few beers back, swap stories, good times.
  
    Regarding other grad departments, I had a handful of friends in the Heinz College programs, two I knew from undergrad and one I met outside of CMU so I can't say much about the vibes with their program but I haven't met one I didn't like so my impression's pretty positive.
  
    The only other grad students I got to know well enough were Tepper grad students. I'm not sure if this is my experience with Tepper people but the ones I talk to don't seem to like or want to know students/campus life outside of their program; much more aggressively than other grad students at CMU. One told me that she wanted the whole Tepper building locked to only Tepper people in order to ""prevent those undergrads from making out all over the building"". Some of them have even gone so far as to create student organizations exclusively for Tepper students, e.g. there's an outdoor club for undergrate + graduate students and there's a second one that Tepper students made for Tepper students. If this is the program you're going into then you may build tight bonds within this group but you'll miss out on CMU's collaborative nature and ability to network across disciplines.
  
    Pittsburgh's a decent Medium sized city, large enough where you have museums, concerts, and sports, but small enough that you can get around most of it in like 20 minutes if you have a car. The bus system is serviceable, I never grew up in a city with good public transit so I don't have a metric besides Pittsburgh but my friends from other major cities go ""it's fine"". Rent during my time was cheap, me and three friends had a 3 bedroom apartment on Wilkins for about $1100/mo so I paid about $320/mo which the $12/hr job working maybe 10hrs/week was enough to cover and then some. This was 10 years ago. I hear the city's a bit more pricy now so it might be trickier. Perhaps find some other grad students and split an apartment like me and my friends did with a friend who's local; Godspeed.
  
    And yes! There is a Hofbrauhaus, I don't know how it compares to the other ones, probably not as good as the original one but then again that's a rather high bar. Beer comes in those glass steins and you can dance on the chairs, but not the tables, there's a live polka band that takes requests. I can't speak to the legitimacy of the experience compared to the real deal but it's worth at least seeing once to check it off the list.
  
    Couple of tips:
  
    -the weather is a strange thing in Pittsburgh. April of I wanna say 2016 we had one day of heavy rain, then a nice 80F sunny day, then snow, all in the same weekend. Helps to have a small umbrella, and a packable jacket in your trunk at all times in case a surprise downpour occurs.
  
    -Grad students did not get Spring Carnival off during my time there. I think it's changed, but if not I highly recommend you at least take the time to enjoy Friday and Saturday and watch the buggy races, enjoy the carnival rides, check out Booth, see the free concert if the act(s) are good.
  
    -Take the fence if you can. It's one of those weird campus traditions where you and your friends will be up all night you might as well paint a fence while you're waiting for your code to compile and have you/your friends/your organization say something to the rest of the campus.
  
    -Generally people at CMU are friendly, we're all just tired and I felt that there was a sense of camaraderie in the fact that we are all going through some flavor of hell and if we can help we can. Sometimes we're too tired/busy and we can't help, it's not you, it's just the project/research/exhaustion kicking our collective asses.
  
    I might have overdone it but I'd rather give you too much info rather than too little. Let me know if you want any details on anything specific.

    These are hard feelings. Yet all is not hopeless. The fact you still are really enjoying the classes despite the difficulty is a good sign.
  
    Malcolm Gladwell’s revisionist history podcast has a two episode arc on what is measured vs what matters - kind of about law school admissions but applicable here. Net sometimes the way school admissions or a path is structured isn’t aligned with what it actually takes to be successful. In the LSAT example - law school admission prioritized the LSAT which is about speed. And that is a predictor for success as a first year law student but NOT success or aptitude as a lawyer as the skill sets are often different. In the actual law - details and deeper thinking often trump speed.
  
    So for your situation - to do math at a high level as a career, the speed with which you get new concepts each semester isn’t necessarily the most important thing. It is likely more about if you get it eventually, your engagement and your resilience when you are in the messy middle of figuring things out.
  
    I think the two episodes are called puzzle rush and the tortoise and the hare.
  
    Truly liking the subject and how demanding it is, being willing and able to collaborate with others and seek help - these are traits that can lead to career success in the field - because they are signs you are willing to do the work and to stick with it when the going is tough.
  
    I have watched brilliant people flame out in the “real world” bc they lacked the resilience and passion to persist and watched a lot of folks who may not have been as academically gifted succeed bc they brought something beyond smarts to the table. The reality is that baseline smarts are needed to put you in the pool of folks. And I bet you have that or cmu wouldn’t have taken you.  Once you have met the threshold of good enough then it is about the work and brilliance doesn’t always win the day in the real world. In fact, sometimes it can get in the way bc it can limit how much you build / focus on other skills including interpersonal skills, work habits, learning how to navigate feeling stuck and how to leverage available resources to get unstuck.
  
    So while you certainly should prioritize mental health, i urge you to consider if it is the work harming it or the habit of comparison. “Comparison is the thief of joy” may apply here, if you love the subject and challenging courses…. And also there is no harm in looking at course selection. You can have courses that are challenging for you and build your skills appropriately sometimes without always aiming for the hardest of everything. Consider talking to some of the profs who help you about the challenge - you love the work and the challenge of it but are just a bit slower to grasp it sometimes - may help them recommend classes that hit your sweet spot. Or they could tell you you are doing better than you think. It is a good way to open the door to a bit more of a relationship with them.  Teachers like students who love their subjects.
  
    Edited to say sorry this is a novela. I empathize highly as this situation is highly relatable to me. And age gave me perspective to realize I was not only fine in my career choice, I was better suited to it and more successful than many who outperformed me at school.

    I would not recommend any of CEE’s MS programs. In addition to the comment above, which talks about irrelevant coursework, I also want to attest to the fact that the department’s MS programs typically attract a lowly, immature bunch of students every year. These students ruin the department’s atmosphere with their crass behaviors, and contribute to the creation of a highly unproductive work environment.
  
    If you are an international student, support provided is highly limited. You will be forced to navigate visa issues and job-hunting all on your own - the department (or the university’s infamous international students’ office) will provide you with no help whatsoever
  
    I really do hope the situation has improved with the department’s change in leadership. The previous department head was extremely ineffective as a leader, and repeatedly failed to address bullying and harassment cases happening right under his nose.

    You don’t have to be in MCS to take 21-242. That being said, entry to 242 is based on performance in the Math Maturity Survey, a placement exam of sorts - information on which is usually sent to math majors and CS majors, and to my knowledge nobody else by default. I took 242 while I was still a ChemE (which, to my knowledge, just isn’t really a thing that happens) - but I did have to advocate for myself hard for e.g. getting the necessary info for the MMS.
  
    What does this actually mean for registration? You’ll register for a section of 241 and then get moved into 242 depending on your exam performance.
  
    As usual with questions like this, the default answer is usually “email Howell” - Dr. Jason Howell is the current director of undergrad studies in the math department, and he’s helped me tremendously through navigating all the hoops to do as much math as possible while I was outside the department. I strongly encourage it.
  
    This description of my experience probably completely identifies me, so if I know you and you see this account, no you didn’t. :)
  
    Edit: I forgot about your second question. Not typically; it depends on the course. Some intro courses have placement tests, which gives you placement but not credit. Generally though, if you got transfer credit for a course you’re good, but if you didn’t then you may have a hard time getting a prereq waived.
  
    For context, I was able to get a prereq waiver for 21-254 because I took 21-242 and 21-269, but it took over a year. Keep in mind that 21-254 is “linear algebra and vector calc for engineers”, 242 is proofy linear algebra, and 269 is vector analysis. Yeah.

    I participated in this and can confirm it’s a great program. I would air on the side of applying even if you’re not sure whether or not you want to do it—it gives you a great internship experience with a stipend for living costs (they even gave the stipend last summer when most internships were remote).
  
    If I remember correctly the application involves a recommendation, essay, and resume. They definitely try to target people who need the experience, so don’t worry if you don’t have much experience. If you’re accepted, you still have to do additional applications and interviews for each internship in the program that you want to apply to, but you’re only competing for those internships with other program participants. And in the end, you’ll probably get an internship. Even if it’s not the one you had your sights set on, all of the internships seemed pretty solid, and the program coordinators offer a lot of support navigating the internships. They do require you to attend extra program-specific career events throughout the end of the year/ summer, but they don’t take up too much time.

    CMU in general is pretty accepting of trans people, although I've found it a little hard to navigate the bureaucracy as a trans person (it's probably important to note I'm not very out so that's probably clouding my experience a bit). I wasn't able to get into gender inclusive housing my sophomore year so I ended up with a random roommate of my assigned gender which was no fun. The freshman housing selection process is different, though, so hopefully it's a bit more accommodating!

    CMU is a pretty liberal campus that is generally accepting, or at least tolerating. It’s not a center of LGBTQ+ social life and activism, but it has some resources and community. The health insurance covers most trans care, and the university’s health services also has great resources. There’s a pretty active undergrad LGBTQ+ club that also hosts a weekly affinity group for transgender and non-binary students. The Center for Diversity and Inclusion has recently begun to make efforts to include Trans-related programming.
  
    Of course, it’s not perfect. I’ve heard two major complaints. Navigating the bureaucracy around transitioning can be difficult if you begin the process while enrolled at cmu (mostly the name-change process). And I’ve heard that a significant number of the all-gender restrooms listed on campus maps are actually in restricted access areas, and the accessible ones are too sparsely distributed to be convenient (please feel free to correct me if that has changed, though). However, I suspect that you will be pleasantly surprised by CMU after living in the south.

    I think you’re right about a lot of this, but I disagree that the students aren’t smart. Most of us are both intelligent and hardworking, and we’re smart enough to have learned to use shortcuts.
  
    Maybe my expectations were skewed coming into this environment (I’m in a Masters program, undergrad is a little different), but I expected deep thinking and very advanced problem solving to be a huge part of the curriculum. I expected to be generating original thought. Instead, you’re right—it’s workhorse training. How much volume can you produce with an impossible deadline? I think that’s a disservice to students who are really quite brilliant and typically already have the work ethic and self discipline.

    CMU admissions are a black box - we don't get to see our admissions files afterwards, or get told ""what"" got us in. a) CMU doesn't tell us and b) admissions are holistic, so I doubt there's any one thing. That being said, you're likely to hear some very high GPAs and standardizing scores because that is the average amongst most admitted students. If you're looking for that information I'd suggest looking up the CDS for CMU. And everyone will have different extracurriculars, some of those in common including olympiads and internships/work experience.
  
    Trying to compare yourself to already admitted students is not the best way of going about this. The important part is focusing on bringing your grades up to the best they can be and partaking in extracurriculars you're actually passionate about. Start your essays early and don't shortcut any part of your app. Hard work and time management will serve you better than any kind of comparison will. Fwiw, my SAT was 1580 and my GPA a 4.0. ECs included research, sport, internships, and music. But I don't think any of this info helps you at all.

    With your intros and math classes you’ll probably spend most of your time between Doherty and Porter Hall . None of the dorms are really that close but I guess going from Morewood there’s shortcuts through the buildings . West Wing is pretty central . if you had a class first thing in the morning in Posner then Donner or Hamerschlag is closest
  
    Generally most of the offices and some classes sit in these areas:
  
    Mech E in Scaife
  
    ECE in Hamerschlag
  
    BME in Scott
  
    EPP in Wean

    I recommend living on the Residence on Fifth (lived in there this year). People hesitate to choose it because it's far, but I think it's really not. There's a shortcut your Orientations Leaders will show you that will take you to campus in 10-15 minutes walking. If you have a bike or skateboard, you could get there faster. You can get to Tepper in 10.
  
    You trade distance for amenities. You get a kitchen and bathroom. The triples are really neat because you have a bedroom, but also a ""living room"" area where the desks, couches and table are. There's a small theatre on the mezzanine floor. Small (very) gym on lobby floor. Closer to all the off-campus food places. Korean super market across the street. Generally, it's more quiet.
  
    As for roommate assignment, you get access to a portal. You can meet people on there through the questionnaire you take about your habits and it matches you. Most people post on the FaceBook and make friend/meet roommates there (highly recommend that. a lot better). Then when you decide, you request them on the portal. You put your preferences housing in order by residence and what room you want (double, triple, etc). Then on assignment day, everyone is assigned a number and they pick at random and assign a room to you and your roommate. So a group of 4 have a higher chance of being picked than 2.

    The ravine was already there, they filled it in. It’s called the cut because it used to be a shortcut for people who go down the ravine and up the other side instead of walking around it. Part of the ravine is still present behind/under Gates and at the bottom of Wean.

    - To me, Doherty is the place where ChemE's go for exile. Jk, but I've been to the labs in the basement, and it is one of the sketchiest and obscure places I've been on-campus so far. In general, I think it's just a very old building
  
    - I go there almost everyday, but primarily for classes. It's also a very useful shortcut to Wean despite the weird floor-matchups (5th floor Wean connects to A-floor Doherty, and 7th floor Wean connects to 2nd floor Doherty). It's not the best place for study/socializing, in my opinion, considering the limited number of seats and tables available
  
    - There is a weird, narrow corridor in Doherty with orange-lighting. I don't remember how I got there or where it connects
  
    - Favorite spot in Doherty Hall is the table on the 2nd floor located near the entrance to Wean 7th floor and the elevator

    I know you said you liked Mudge but I lived in Rez on Fifth and loved it! You get your own personal bathroom, living room (more space!), and kitchenette. Also a full fridge to store all the food you get from the wonderful city of pittsburgh, which is only 10-15 min away walking and probably 3 min by bus. Campus is not far either, also 10-15 min away if you know all the shortcuts ;) had lots of fun cooking with my roommates and neighbors at 1am. freshman year was a blast.

    Yeah I agree, I think it would be helpful if there was just a nice pdf map that said which floors of buildings connect to each other (4th floor Wean to 2nd floor Newell-Simon to 4th floor Gates-Hillman for example), which floor of buildings doors are on (Wean front door on floor 5, back door on floor 1, etc), and maybe some general sense of the topography outside. Maybe such a thing exists, idk! But I've never found it if so.
  
    Until then, we rely on trial and error or building-specific searches to realize that you can get from Margeret Morrison to Wean 6th floor quickest by entering Doherty, but only if you go up a floor and back down or down a floor and back up. Like someone else said, I guess you realize this after a few weeks, and then can enjoy your slight shortcuts.

    Techspark has pretty absurd costs. Unless theyâ€™ve dropped, itâ€™s like $0.50 a gram. So like itâ€™s cheaper to buy an entire printer for yourself if you just want to print a single roll of filament. Also last time I printed there (which was like 3 years ago bc it was such a bad experience) I think we just sent the STL to them and they were the ones that sliced it and set up the printer. But they didnâ€™t really know what they were doing so the bed adhesion was horrendous and the part was unusable, and for a bit they refused to reprint it. Techspark is fine just as a workspace and maybe for hand tools and a couple specialty machines, but itâ€™s essentially for-profit which means itâ€™s not great for getting materials/printing
  
    ideate also has some printers I believe, I think you need to be enrolled in an ideate class to use them though. Not sure how they are about letting you keep using them after finishing the class. Also some labs and clubs will have their own if they need it. https://ideate.cmu.edu/resources/guides/3d-printers/index.html

    My personal recommendation is Roboclub, essentially unlimited 3D printing on some of the nicest FDM machines at the university (Bambu X1 carbons). Also a couple resin printers but that is overkill for most applications. Website is currently down but should be back online sometime soon: https://roboticsclub.org Itâ€™s a very very reasonable price. Plus access to tons of electronics parts, laser cutting, and a machine shop. All stuff that you could get access to through something like techspark, but only after taking classes that are hard to get into.

    Depends on who you ask LOL mine is definitely not that high but many peopleâ€™s are. I donâ€™t think a high GPA is that important unless you plan to go to grad school though, you definitely donâ€™t need a 3.7+ to get internships and stuff
  


    This probably depends on your courses â€” I generally have a problem set due every week for my math classes and programming/written every week for CS classes. This generally translates to doing work for at least one class every day, but I donâ€™t do work for all of them every day.
  


    My time management techniques are pretty subpar so Iâ€™m probably not the best person to ask but I try to start assignments early enough that I can go to office hours if I need to, and I try to review content before starting my assignments because that ends up cutting down a lot of time youâ€™d otherwise just be staring at problems confused. I think you also just need to be comfortable with the idea that not everything will click right away so you might just need to wade through the confusion for a bit until it marinates for long enough that it starts making sense.

    So the admin shouldn't be held accountable for failing to get donations for the things they promise in the master plan? It's on the first page of the master plan.  I get that it would be a big price tag but things included in the campus master plan should be realistic.   I suspected from the first time I saw it in the plan that the admin is way too cheap to pay for it.  A large portion of the multibillion dollar endowment is not directed/restricted anyway.
  
    It's a matter of pedestrian safety on Forbes.   They have pushed a lot of undergrads to live in the craig st corridor but it's too crowded on the forbes rd panther hollow bridge and everybody cutting through NS and Wean. Its going to actually make the situation worse because it will have classrooms that are isolated from the rest of campus and force people to go back and forth over the forbes bridge.  The new bridge would have benefited undergrads with classes in porter/baker/schlag/scaife.  But maybe the admin doesn't care about that.
  
    Maybe its still part of the plan but I'm skeptical that there is no mention of plans for a future bridge being incorporated into the new building...

    You really think this is strictly about republicans being for forced birth while being against making sure that infants and young children have food, shelter, and medical care?  That certainly contributes to this but there's so, so much more.
  
    Just like the republican party is performative when it says it cares about children but when it actually has to deal with children they refuse to actually follow through, the republican party is similarly performative about ""supporting the troops"".  But republicans are against providing necessary additional funding for the VA.  The Trump administration forced the purge of hundreds of thousands of health care applications to the VA and have routinely tried to cut VA benefits.  On the other hand we have to have VA facilities in Mexico to support the many veterans who have been deported because republicans refuse to support legislation to provide even greencards, let alone actual citizenship to people who join the military and leave with honorable discharges.
  
    Then we have all of the animosity towards LGBTQ people.  If you think I need to expound on this I can only laugh at you.
  
    Then there's the active courting of white nationalism.  We literally had Republicans saying that it was unfair to ask that Trump denounce white supremacists because they're part of his base.
  
    Do I need to go on?  Because I've got a lot more that I could write.  When many republicans are saying that anyone who doesn't support Trump or the republican party is an enemy that may need to be dealt with with violence, that doesn't really bode well for ""getting along"".

    I've mostly done with replying to the other fellow, who's welcome to hold his own opinion. You might be interested in knowing that part of the deal with being a prof at an elite school is apparently ""you should bring in enough grant money to cover your own salary and more"", which is why I find the situation of profs somehow being less valued than the execs rather sad. To my knowledge, it's not like the execs are supporting the professors in writing their NSF grants -- the profs just kind of need to bring in big money on their own, or else they won't get tenure.
  
    Specifically, it's not like all the grant money magically comes in through the university execs. From what I can tell, the professors mostly apply for grants or seek funding on their own, the university takes their cut (53% ish -- to be fair CMU is one of the lowest here, and in practice it may work out closer to 30-40%), and then the professors have to pay for themselves (summer months) and their students with the leftovers.
  
    So, within this system, I feel like the professors are really getting the short end of the stick / they're not the problem. Not saying that you think they are, just sharing information that I was very surprised to learn as an undergrad.
  
    This book is a work-in-progress, but if the paragraphs above made you go ???, the funding chapter should be interesting reading: https://vijay03.github.io/asstprofbook/

Industry applicability?



    As my flair says, I am not currently in industry.
  


    However, I was lucky enough to intern at one of the AWS database teams for a summer. At that point, I had taken 440, 445, 721.
  


    My summer was basically spent staring at perf, reducing contention, and optimizing code. Something like: my manager thinks X is a bottleneck, can I prove it? how much can it be improved? (Incidentally, it is possible to make a system too fast. Extra work that is generated like garbage collection and replication has to be able to keep up, otherwise you run the risk of instability. Unless you're a HFT shop and you do the ""buy more RAM, disable GC, restart daily"" strategy [5]. Systems are fun! but I digress.)
  


    On applicability: unsurprisingly, the database courses 445 and 721 were the most relevant, followed probably by 440 (for general background knowledge / ""systems thinking""). In retrospect and counterfactually, 410 and 418 are more in the ""arguably useful background information but also not really necessary"".
  


    One shortcoming IMO of our current systems curriculum is that we do not really seem to have an emphasis on performance profiling and optimization anywhere. If you knew the courses and their projects, you'd think that would be 418, but at least in the semester I took it, that wasn't the case. You can get your systems concentration without really ingraining something like [6]. If you care about this, I suggest picking it up in your own time during winter break or something. Brendan Gregg [7] and Agner Fog [8] are both good resources.
  


    In general, I would be surprised if 440 and 445 did not appear on a ""most broadly applicable"" list from someone who's taken those courses. With that said, there are definitely jobs out there where 410 (VMWare? assuming they will still exist post Broadcom...) or 411 (many different compilers teams) or 418 (probably scientific computing), etc, are the most applicable. It depends on what you want to do.
  
The margin over self-study

    Rather than run through each course, I will list out various factors that you might want to consider.
  


    Internship opportunities: some courses bring in companies and engineers with recruiting power (not recruiters! there's a difference), e.g., 445 usually does this, storage systems does this too. This is a huge opportunity, don't skip guest lectures! These are often a ticket to actually working on systems in industry, either as an intern or full-time.
  


    Research opportunities: most courses transition naturally into research opportunities with the professors that taught it. If you want to do research, you usually should get started by junior year -- this doesn't leave you a lot of time, so you should strategically pick courses here.
  


    Availability of material: not all courses are equally available online. Everything in 445 is online except for the exams (though as a CMU student with the chance to take it, I think it would be a mistake to self-study it). Not much is online for 410's project infrastructure.
  


    Project discipline: it is highly unlikely (though possible) that you will write your own OS or compiler if coursework isn't making you do so.
  


    There are probably more factors, but I notice I've been writing this comment for over an hour and I should either go back to sleep or start doing work, so I'm cutting it short here.
  
Side note 1

    Although I did not take 411, someone whose opinion I trust a lot says that it was one of their most useful courses. They did compilers research and currently work in the low-latency high-performance space. It certainly has much better developed infrastructure than most of the other systems courses, and is likely to be better structured in general. I would consider trying to fit this into your course schedule somewhere.
  
Side note 2

    I strongly encourage you to consider taking at least one grad course. These tend to be less work and more research/reading heavy. In my opinion, you should learn how to read industry research papers, so that you can keep up with the field even when you're done with CMU.
  
Side note 3

    If you take a partner project course with a friend, you may want to be prepared to solo the course or lose that friend (and possibly some of your friend group with them). I have been aware of multiple situations in 410, 411, etc. where one person does the majority of the work and the other coasts to an A. I'm not talking about a 60/40 split of work either, which IMO is still reasonable -- think 90/10 or 95/5. It's a team effort and the exact breakdown of work doesn't matter that much, but sometimes the team practically speaking is just you.
  
    This is written assuming that you'll usually be on the contributing side of things (that you like doing a systems concentration more than the idea of doing a systems concentration). Otherwise, pretend you never read this. :) In retrospect, I lucked out massively with my OS partner and I think he's the only partner I had where I think I was less critical to the project (40/60 to 45/55 seems like a fair assessment).
  
Side note 4

    I'm pretty passionate about our undergrad CS curriculum -- I genuinely think it is one of the best and broadest at an undergrad level -- and this is particularly the case for our systems offerings, which aim to get you to really write code. Most people don't write enough code. I always thought it would be nice to have a more established undergrad systems community. If you want to chat more about our systems courses or curriculum, feel free to DM.

    Just a couple of points,
  


    If you see unused lights and appliances, report it to facilities. They should have shut it down a few weeks ago AFAIK. Some facilities, for example humidity control, computer servers, bio labs, etc., probably still need to be running.
  


    You can direct all complaints about ""what courses are online?"" to the registrar, I believe they're behind on that.
  


    If you have personal hardships related to COVID19, please apply to TESF and contact The Hub.
  


    I would actually rather have schools with large endowments and correspondingly large legal teams take up the main lawsuits against ICE.
  


    I like complaining about tuition as much as the average student, but I'm also very much a realist. We've had easily over a hundred staff furloughed for budgetary reasons, and I think we're even stopping some building renovations until the budget situation is more stable -- so if the tuition increase doesn't go through, who do you think should get fired / where should the money to pay CMU employees come from?
  


    I'm also an international student. If you have actionable proposals which I find reasonable, I'd be happy to support them, but I think it is important to be reasonable. Right now, your main complaint seems to be tuition, which is a tough matter - what do you want CMU to cut?
  
    That said, I agree that CMU would benefit its student population greatly if it had a guaranteed tuition program / tuition lock. I have floated this idea to some friends in senate before, but I don't think they were very interested.

TLDR the toughness is from lack of good infra and not from the actual course content

    There's 2 versions of it (fall, Go), (spring, Java). I've heard projects and topics differ slightly across the two versions and generally people recommend Go. But nobody ever takes both versions lol so I feel like there's not direct point of comparison.
  
    I'm taking it this spring (Java). I enjoy the lecture / lecture content. The professors are great at answering questions with concrete examples and their expertise really shows. Multiple alum told me that this was the most generally useful systems class in industry for SWEs, but I haven't graduated yet, so I don't have a personal anecdote for it.
  
    OK now that's out of the way.. rant time hahaha. The assignments feel..... kinda weird. Like a significant portion the written hws are arithmetic problems (calculate the time it takes expected for packet x of size y to send given z sending conditions) but we NEVER go through any examples of them in class. When asking on piazza for support, the answer is that they should be treated as ""fun word problems"". Sigh idk man if much of the class isn't getting it, then maybe it's because the teaching staff isn't doing their job, rather than the students all collectively being stupid. And the pset questions are really vague, you need to stalk piazza for clarifications. I actually recommend starting psets later for this reason.
  
    There's also lack of student tools for testing code. When we ask for help on piazza on why certain things are failing, the staff says ""write a test case for it"". There were no examples on how to write these cases so that our program could run them. Like it seems really simple to know how to write these, so trivial that the course could not bother to explain it. However that's where MANY students were tripped up in the earlier projects. Also the staff's attitude has been kind of uhhh.. inflexible. Each programming assignment's time varies wildly. Recently we had an assignment that took many times more hours than the other ones. We had lots of time to do it, but of course, most people submitted late. This was also when andrew servers were shitting themselves from too much vscode ssh, and 440 needs to be run on 64-bit linux. There were some students asking for additional support, but the staff was lowkey blaming the students for not budgeting their time. Once again.. if it's extremely typical of SO many students to struggle with this, it might be because the infra is not set up for us to succeed. i might edit this later to cut out some stuff but that's just off the top of my head, hope it helps.

    I completed a non-CS major at an Ivy (not Brown) for undergrad and am now doing my Master's at SCS. While I'm extremely jealous of the quality of CS courses and cutting-edge research experience that the CMU undergrads have access to, I'm still very grateful for the four years of liberal arts education that 1) taught me how to read, write, and communicate persuasively 2) allowed me to explore different majors (Ivy's allow until the spring semester of Sophomore year to declare your major), and 3) have friends who have various interests/talents.
  


    Within my master's program cohort, Iâ€™ve encountered many people who are extremely quantitatively gifted, yet fail to succinctly articulate their ideas verbally or through writing despite English being their native language. Being able to quickly scan materials â€” whether it be textbooks, research papers, or even earning call transcripts â€” and develop your arguments is an extremely valuable skill that matters both in the academia and in the industry since you will always be pitching your ideas to other people (unless youâ€™re completely OK with just quietly closing out Jira tickets or stuttering during your biweekly Demo). These are skills that can only be refined when you're exposed to a well-rounded curriculum that involves reading 30+ books a semester, debating your classmates in a <20 person classroom setting for 4 hours per week, and actually receiving well-thought-out feedback on your writing. Yes, one can argue that you can always purchase books on Amazon and start book clubs, but not many of us take the initiative to do that, do we?
  


    Iâ€™ve switched my major from Sociology, Linguistics, Art History, and various other things until I eventually declared Economics in the spring semester of my Sophomore year. If I had to commit to a single major from Freshman year, I definitely could have gotten more in-depth with one discipline but also would have never had the chance to explore my full scope of interests or think about what would make me feel most fulfilled in life. The average quality of classes for non-CS departments is undoubtedly better at an Ivy.
  


    Iâ€™m also grateful that my college friends consist of people with a diverse set of academic and professional interests ranging from Investment Banking, Law, Consulting, Neuroscience, Art History, Music, etc. whoâ€™ve always challenged me and still challenge me to stay curious about many different topics. CMU may be beneficial if you knew from age 17 that you will always want to work in tech, but youâ€™ll most likely find yourself talking about the latest current events in tech over brunch with everyone who also works in tech when you move to SF in a few years anyway.There are clear pros and cons, so take your pick. Do keep in mind that youâ€™ve posted on the CMU subreddit, so youâ€™ll obviously be receiving an overwhelming majority of comments in favor of SCS.

    (Disclaimer: I'm not a Stats ML major but Im a Stats minor and I think I know the Stats ML major requirements sufficiently well. Someone pls correct me if there's an issue with this)
  
    Here's what I think is the fastest path you could take, assuming you have the AP credit for it. This is almost certainly overkill and unrealistic, but I guess aim to do what you can to get ""close"" to this when possible. E.g. you may not (probably will not) be able to take 36-225 Freshman Fall, which would push back 36-225, 36-226, 36-401, and 36-402 by a year; you may find that taking 10-301 and/or 15-351 Freshman year makes no sense / is insane. You may also not have the AP credits I reference, delaying some things here or there by a semester or a year, which is ok.
  
    Freshman Fall:
  


    (Assuming you have credit for Calc 1 and 2) Take 21-259
  


    Talk with the stats advisor to see if they'll let you take 36-225 concurrently with 21-259 (you may have to be somewhat aggressive about asking about it, as usually 21-259 is a prereq, but I ~think~ it's been done before)
  


    (Assuming you have credit for 15-112) Take 15-122
  


    Take 21-127 (or take it in the Spring)
  


    Fill your remaining slots with Freshman 5 courses and other Gen Eds
  


    (This also assumes you have credit for 36-200)
  


    Freshman Spring:
  


    36-226 and 36-202
  


    21-241 (or maybe 21-240, but 241 is your best option here imo)
  


    (Take 21-127 if you didn't take it in the Fall)
  


    Consider taking 15-351, but I'm not sure how difficult this course is so you may want to take it later
  


    If you took 21-127 in the Fall, you can also take 10-301 in the Spring
  


    If space remains, knock out more Freshman 5 courses or gen eds (you may be able to get away with taking Freshman 5 courses in later years; if not then you would need to make space, at the expense of 10-301 and 15-351)
  


    Sophomore Fall:
  


    36-401 (you need 36-226, 21-241, and 36-202 to be able to take this here, I think)
  


    If you haven't taken them yet, 10-301 and/or 15-351 (idk if they're offered both semesters so you may have to wait until the Spring, and/or you may ONLY be able to take them in the Fall rather than Freshman/Sophomore Spring)
  


    36-350 now or later
  


    Free space (see below for what's left)
  


    Beyond Sophomore Fall (what's left):
  


    Anything from above that you haven't taken yet
  


    36-402
  


    1 advanced ML elective
  


    2 advanced Stats electives (see NOTE below)
  


    Remaining gen eds (NOTE: 36-315 knocks out both a ""creating"" gen ed and an advanced Stats gen ed. See if there are similar opportunities to knock out gen eds with major requirements, as that cuts down the number of required courses)
  


    Is there some senior capstone/thesis requirement? Idts but maybe
  


    Anything else I missed (did I miss anything? Strong maybe)
  


    Enough additional courses to get you to 360 total units
  


    ðŸŽ¶And a partridge in a pear treeðŸŽ¶
  


    As you can see, your second half of your time here would entail fewer courses if you took this ""fastest possible route,"" so you have the buffer space to slow things down here and there as needed/desired. And again, to emphasize, doing this exactly as I've layed it out above is very unrealistic, just treat it as a bound on how fast you can go through the major instead of as your actual path.

    I could see a potential in a social aspect- sharing cut throughs or routes that optimize other factors- slope,  crowdedness, indoors vs outdoors? As a masters student in an interdisciplinary program im finding myself constantly traversing back and forth across different sections of campus in a way that isnt quite falling into a specific routine.
  
    Its true though that after a little time routes are figured out naturally and a map ceases to be as useful but i guess iâ€™m more interested in it as an interesting data source/ widget rather than an app iâ€™d need user retention on?

    Least elevation: Shadyside, pretty flatMost elevation: Right at the bottom of Sq Hill south, quite a bit of a climb to go up Murray, but not too bad. You can also cut across through schenley which has a slightly smoother gradient.I live in the Sq. Hill area and bike my 10 speed mtb very frequently to campus. I got used to the elevation eventually, and since I bike on mtb trails it was more beneficial to be near to frick park.If you have a road bike it will be all the more easier since they are lighter and have a large gear selection.Not all roads have bike lanes, but from my 4 year experience in Pittsburgh, if you ride to the side of the road, most drivers are courteous and give ample space before passing you.

    First Welcome to CMU! I've only been here for a short time and I can tell you I've enjoyed it. (but that might just be the honeymoon phase talking). As someone else mentioned I would recommend reading James Hoe's advice page. He has seen tons of students pass through the ECE program and knows what works and what doesn't (He'll also probably get you pretty fired up about the wonderful world of Computer Architecture).
  
    I'm a first-year so I'll give you my opinions 1 year out (in?)
  
    1.i) COVID has made things hard this year but you can get an internship the first year summer. Generally speaking this is rare for the first summer (esp with covid), but internships become more common and easier each year. I've had a lot of trouble finding summer positions but I'm not sure if this is because of COVID or lack of experience or a combination of both. Summer after Junior year is sometimes thought to be most important because many students get return offers which makes the job search during the spring much easier.
  
    1.ii) You'll have to take the class before you can become a TA so it will most likely be after Freshman spring. Some tips: you'll want to have a) done well in the class and b) spoken with the professor before hand (not necessary but often helpful). I applied to TA this spring semester. You'll also want to plan your schedule out for TAing. ECE is a rigorous program, and being a TA means that other students rely on you for success in the course. This means you'll have to intentionally schedule a semester to be relatively easy to ensure your success in classes and the success of the students you're working with. It's by no means impossible but does require some careful planning. Most students who want to TA end up doing so, but sometimes it can be difficult to do so for a particular class. Most Undergrad TAs are in CS, because the intro classes tend to hire the most students.
  
    1.iii) I got a Research position before the fall semester started. So really you can kind of start as soon as you get a CMU email (external emails tend to get lost in the spam filter). CMU uses Handshake, a job application/ job search platform, for all on-campus jobs. As soon as postings start coming up you can apply. I would wait at least until the summer before sending emails as many labs may not have their fall budgets sorted out until then
  
    2) There are tons of competitions. Hackathons, Robotics, etc. They can be kind of hard to find if you don't know where to look, but there are tons of clubs which will make postings about that kind of stuff. It'll be easier once you know what you want to compete in. If your looking for an internal competition, Build18 is a competition run by students out of the ECE department which many ECE students compete in.
  
    3) ECE is hard, but that's what makes it rewarding. I haven't taken much of the upper class curriculum so I can't comment on difficulty, but I can say that from my first semester, keeping a daily schedule is super important. That might just be the quarantine depression talking, but without any tine structure it was easy to fall behind. Keep yourself honest, stay on top, and ask for help when you fall. CMU has a TON of support structures for students who fall behind. You're about to pay a lot of money for services you may never use. If you need those services ask for them. One of the great things about private school is that you are a customer; you're entitled to more than the fancy name on a resume.
  
    4)Exercise daily, weekly at the worst. Personal fitness will do wonders for your energy and your focus. It's super easy to get lost in the work, never take breaks, but you have to take care of yourself. AND SHOWER... There's a joke the SCS kids don't shower, but its more real than it should be. Instead of asking how you can prepare for your future, start asking how you can be better today. It'll make things a lot easier.
  
    5) not everything is about landing a big job. There are a lot of opportunities at CMU that will pass you by if you're not careful. Do things that you'd never do. There are plenty of things that you can learn ""for free"" here at CMU that you'd have to pay a lot of money somewhere else (Glass blowing, Acting, Laser Cutting, 3D printers, singing, yoga, etc.) make sure you set out to explore everything. Don't just tunnel vision on the FAANG internship and sequester yourself in your room.
  
    p.s. lots of people will say that they're trying to learn X skill so that they can work with Y company. This is a flawed mindset. Work on projects which solve a problem or are fun to do. That will serve you so much better in the interview than saying you're certified with [insert tool/skill which will become outdated in 3 years].

    Showcase - great barbecue place. I like their corn bread, beans and rice, Mac and cheese, and collards https://maps.app.goo.gl/nzLKeMByUMFH81T58?g_st=ic

    Kavsar - pickup-only Uzbek restaurant. If you haven’t had Uzbek food before I recommend you try it https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcd1atPmSZ7aoT2S7?g_st=ic

    Everyday Noodles is one of my favorite spots. Straightforward Chinese noodle bowls, I like the dan dan noodles a lot, generally prefer their dry bowls to soup bowls, but everything is good. You can see them making the noodles which is fun https://maps.app.goo.gl/sgKnXoFLpUJPgspQA?g_st=ic

However, I’d also like to mention Mardi Gras in Shadyside, which is a cash only smoke lounge/bar. Maybe my favorite bar in the world, but if you’re sensitive to smoke/smells be careful https://lemardigras.com/about-le-mardi-gras/

    Just google the list of museums in the city, they’re all good
  
    Randyland is an outdoor art project thing run by a local folk artist for a few decades now I believe. It’s in the middle of the Mexican War Streets which have some very pretty old row houses, plus the Mattress Factory

    You don't want to be known as the guy who snitched on a classmate. If word ever gets out, your social life is destroyed in an instant, since your friends won't know if what they say to you can be used against them.
  


    Unless proficiency in English is relevant to your major, it should not have an impact on his contributions. Bridging language gaps is a key skill that will help you a lot more in the later parts of your life. I had a similar case during my Masters program with a student who first learned English at the age of 14. While it was challenging at times to decipher what he meant, a lot of what he had to say had a tremendous amount of impact on our contributions.
  


    These tests are outrageous. 99% of the vocabulary requested in these tests are not in use in either your classes or in regular conversations. While I did not cheat on them, I would completely understand the impulse to do so because it was a lot of rote memorization that was ultimately obsolete.
  


    There is simply nothing you gain from his absence. Your course work will be just as challenging. If he's truly an imposter, he will be weeded out sooner or later in life.

    What happened to the bridge across panther hollow they have promised for over ten years?
  
"

    We haven't seen the full design yet, and it's also possible the bridge is part of the future design additions. It is still part of the 2022 Master Plan, and Bob Reppe has definitely said it was something he wanted.
  
    They are also actively redesigning the Forbes Bridge right now.
  
"

    So the admin shouldn't be held accountable for failing to get donations for the things they promise in the master plan? It's on the first page of the master plan.  I get that it would be a big price tag but things included in the campus master plan should be realistic.   I suspected from the first time I saw it in the plan that the admin is way too cheap to pay for it.  A large portion of the multibillion dollar endowment is not directed/restricted anyway.
  
    It's a matter of pedestrian safety on Forbes.   They have pushed a lot of undergrads to live in the craig st corridor but it's too crowded on the forbes rd panther hollow bridge and everybody cutting through NS and Wean. Its going to actually make the situation worse because it will have classrooms that are isolated from the rest of campus and force people to go back and forth over the forbes bridge.  The new bridge would have benefited undergrads with classes in porter/baker/schlag/scaife.  But maybe the admin doesn't care about that.
  
    Maybe its still part of the plan but I'm skeptical that there is no mention of plans for a future bridge being incorporated into the new building...

    I also had to choose between CMU and Cornell! I had another opinion of Cornell going in lol, mainly because I’m from NY and my school feeds into Cornell. I’ve heard all the stories of depression from there, especially from the engineering school. They had to put a net under what the students called the “suicide bridge” so do what you will with that. The surrounding area is basically only a college town, so you can’t really go out anywhere else besides school. They also sent me a likely letter, but I couldn’t shake all the stories of being depressed from my friends and classmates who went there. Keep in mind I am very biased due to the people I know so take what I say with a grain of salt.
  
    In terms of CS CMU and Cornell aren’t even close. The huge amount of opportunities with jobs and internships are almost just handed to you, especially as you go closer towards graduation. The breadth in CS and the support is amazing too. There is only one CS major in Cornell Engineering, while at CMU SCS, you can choose between CS, AI, comp bio, and human-computer interaction. Besides the primary majors, there’s additional majors/concentrations in Robotics, systems, language technologies (like NLP), computer graphics, ML, security, and software engineering. In Ideate there are minors in game design & animation and much more. You’ll learn all about these majors in the freshman immigration course if you choose to go here.
  
    Besides having so much to explore in SCS itself, CMU is also interdisciplinary, and you’re able to take essentially any class you want. I took a Body Politics class once and talked about the clitoris all day. It was awesome.
  
    Addressing the depression at CMU, it’s not going to be much worse at what is happening at Cornell. I don’t really experience this, but I think for those that are depressed, they’re mainly depressed at work in the classes, not competition. You bond with the people you’re taking these classes with, and you help each other succeed.
  
    I ultimately chose CMU due to these reasons and I don’t regret my choice one bit. I almost went to Cornell too because I hadn’t heard of CMU before applying to college but now that I’ve spent 4 years here, I can safely say you would be throwing away a huge professional/educational opportunity if you chose Cornell. Congrats though on getting in all 3 schools, that’s a huge accomplishment!! :)

    I go up to the Allegheny national Forest fairly often. There's a lot of good hiking out there, especially around the kinzua area. About 40 minutes away from the kinzua area, is an old bridge that got knocked over by a freak tornado. There are hiking trails all around. Highly recommend.

    Is it through NSH and Wean
  

    Yes, I think it’s this one.
  
    I’d guess the best way is going around the East side of Hamburg Hall (unless you are on the far West side of Tepper and go out the Tepper 1 door, then go on the West side), then entering NSH, going up a floor in the stairs in its lobby, crossing the bridge to Wean 4, going up a flight to Wean 5, then crossing that quad to Porter.
  
    Going down to Wean 1 takes too long because slow elevator and stairs adds time too, and avoiding Wean entirely (such as going past the fence) is too circuitous.

    Hey I'm a five year alumnus from the CEE undergrad program. I loved remediation and groundwater management so that was my focus. The department is pretty small, even as CMU is fairly small this is definitely one of the smaller departments. It means you get really close, which is great since most of your work will be in teams for labs and reports and such. They have dedicated undergraduate teaching professors who are there for you and take you through your tenure there up to your capstone class. You're really there to learn how to solve problems, work in teams, and write reports for different groups of people. You'll learn either how to do things technically or how to manage time/people/resources, and you'll do it while being expected to excel at one of the hardest schools in the country. If you like infrastructure development, cleaning our environment, becoming a bridge between communities and experts, being of real use to the world, I would recommend this program.
  
    You'll also be setting yourself on track to get a PE as this is an accredited program. They have their own career fair since CMU's general fairs don't always draw the companies we'll end up at, so they made their own. I worked for a contracting company (from that job fair) for a while, got a Master's, then wound up at an environmental consulting firm.
  
    I'll add they only created the environmental degree program this past year or so, and while I'm very jealous new students get to have that, I'm also very happy new students get to have that. I can't speak for the current state of the department but I think it was a great place for me. Hopefully will be for you, too!

    BCSA/Design '21 alum here. Here are my notes on Doherty
  


    I had a couple classes in Doherty during my time at CMU and OH MY GOD it was impossible to find your room on the first day of classes. The building is laid out so illogically (which makes it kind of charming, but still a pain in the ass).
  


    Most of the upper levels are split and completely unconnected in the middle, save for that one level (floor 2 or 3, I don't remember) they just stuck a covered bridge in. It's honestly one of the funniest architectural features on campus to me.
  


    A pretty decent section of the basement levels of the building belong to the School of Art and it's this amazing case study on how artists occupy space in the same building differently from other academics. You can tell once you're in one of the art sections of the building. (Also, Art's digital print studio is in Doherty and it's totally worth trying to finagle your way into if you want access to some tools Design doesn't have).
  


    If you go to the backside of the building (the side that faces Gates), there's a staircase that runs the entire height of the building and has windows on three sides the whole way up.
  


    At the bottom level, under the stairs, is a tiny closet, literally a hole in the wall, that the art students sometimes reserve to do installation pieces in. It's an absolutely bizarro thing to discover in the middle of the night when you're lost in Doherty.
  


    At the top of that staircase is a door to access the roof closed with a padlock. If you're lucky it might be unlocked (though it probably won't be so don't get your hopes up).
  




    The floors in Wean and Doherty are fairly misaligned. This becomes apparent in the elevator between the two and in that liminal space where the two buildings blend into each other.
  


    There is a teeny-tiny museum of scientific instruments on level 1 (I think). I don't think anybody pays attention to it but it's a fun detail.
  


    This is going to be somewhat useless because I don't totally remember where it is, but near one of the elevators on the art levels of Doherty is a fairly useful map of what's going on in each floor of the building. I don't remember whether it's the whole building or just the lower levels, but regardless, it's helpful if you're trying to figure out the maze that is the building.
  


    Like all the Hornbostel buildings [ie the original ones] on campus, if you look up at where the roof meets the exterior walls, there's ceramic detailing that's unique to the building. Once you start paying attention to it, it's a gorgeous little detail of the original campus.
  


    I think I did the same project you're doing now when I was at CMU. Honestly I had a lot of fun just trying to figure out the madness of that building

    it can depend on the company. i know one where someone reneged at a consulting company and the hiring manager was just like shucks and moved on. I know investment firms taking reneging more seriously and spread word around to other companies, so I'd imagine more older, conservative companies may have a higher risk of reneging. I've also heard of someone reneging at a bank (not major one but not small either) and it turned out fine, but their explanation was 'for personal reasons'. The bridge is likely temporarily burned, no one is going to keep track of you for too long, you could probably reapply in about 5 years or so or sooner depending on how much the company cares

    Phipps Conservatory or the Carnegie Museums are solid, or take a bicycle or walk through the nearby parks.  Warhol/Mattress Factory/Randyland in the North Side, which is a hike, but really good.
  
    Squirrel Hill Night Market last week was good.  The Strip District is kinda cliche, but worth wandering through at least once in awhile.  (Ethnic groceries, tourist-market shops, restaurants, and Edgar's Best Tacos, which are outstanding.)
  
    Spirit, Cavo, Cattivo, Hot Mass, all have had some good dance nights, and they're not all all-ages, but some are.  There's a ton of music in this city, but a lot of it involves heading medium-far off campus.  Curious to see if The Bridge in East Liberty does well, they just opened up, and yeah, look good.
  
    Pirates games are still fairly cheap, especially for standing room tickets; you can sit off the left field wall in the restaurant, which is a great view of the field.  Riverhounds are the city soccer club, and their tickets are nearly free.  Hockey and football are $$$$.
  

    Mostly though, if you're a first year here, the best thing is to meet more people until you find the ones that click.

    Well, it wasn't a slogan but for years there was this outline of hair and mustache of a student that rowdy architecture kids painted everywhere they could on campus to mock him. It was painted on walls, in elevators, flyers and more. According to what intel I could gather, they may have even tried to make a table and chairs out of it and landed themselves on the Architecture School black list for it. I wouldn't be surprised if some of that graffiti still exists in some dark corner of the underground tunnels or that secret student storage room of theirs over in [redacted].
  
    There was also a vintage ""Kilroy was here"" behind a studio water fountain.
  
    And when the CFA shelves built by DFAB were torn down, there was found a slogan having being written on many of the wood parts that ""J.W. is a tool.""  Also written in the Maggie Mo archie bathroom.

    Welcome! I may be underestimating a 5 min walk but it's definitely less than 10. Depending on what time you get there, you shouldn't have to park terribly far passed the pool itself. Also, you can cut the corner by walking on the street via the underpass on panther hollow road rather than following the pedestrian walkway that loops you around to a different tunnel. I've been walking it for years.

    B in 112 is fine. Best tip for transferring is to take the same courses that IS majors of your year are taking so that you are on track to graduate. Most current IS sophomores have taken:
  


    67-250 IS Milieux - Freshman fall
  


    You will be one of the late-transfer juniors who take this class their junior spring. These students typically take 262 jr fall, then 250 & 272 concurrently in jr spring.
  




    67-262 Database design and dev - Soph fall (FALL ONLY)
  


    must already be in IS to take this class
  




    67-272 App design and dev - soph spring now (SPRING ONLY)
  


    must already be in IS to take this class. 262 is a pre-req, so it's impossible to be a potential transfer taking this anyway.
  




    15-122 or 15-121 - freshman spring or sophomore fall
  


    take this asap, over the summer if you can. It's a hard class though
  




    Apply this semester, don't miss the deadline. You need your advisor to approve/write something so don't procrastinate. Learn the flexible paths that the cmu IS program has to offer. They want to know that you've done your research and can take full advantage of the program given your archie background, rather than being tunnel-visioned into swe. What have you learned from your 2 years of architecture about your likes/dislikes that made you gravitate towards IS? Explore, but know what you want. IS is flexible, but you need to take advantage of that to have a goal and a certain path you want to take, especially with only 2 years left.
  
    Do a UX internship or summer research (suggestion: HCI department) this summer -- more doable than SWE  given your design background. It should help you decide between UX or SWE because prepping for those 2 careers is different, especially as a rising junior.
  
    If you don't get in, another option is doing the 4-year Arch BA program and taking some HCI  classes. You can apply your design training for UX -- something that non-CFA students may lack.
  
    Good luck.

    I feel you man. I hated much of my time at CMU. the culture was terrible enough for me to outweigh the great resources available, and I experienced what you’re talking about with people acting smart for its own sake.

Thankfully the degree does actually come in handy a ton, much more than I expected... so it was for sure worth it in the end.

    Unless they've closed it off, there used to be a trap door in the Doherty basement (maybe level 1 or 2 basement?) in front of the art studios, near the entrance to Wean.

    You would have to take an uber or bus even if you were to stay at a hotel, so you may as well go to campus instead. If you don't have a lot of luggage, bus is fine - download the Transit app ahead of time so you can buy a digital ticket without dealing with cash. There's basically only one bus (28X) and it goes between CMU campus and the airport. As long as you don't get off in downtown (it'll be pretty obvious - high rise buildings and not many people), it'll be very safe. Uber is fine as well, and I'd recommend sharing your location + ride details with someone if you feel at all unsafe. Also let your RA (or someone in Pittsburgh) know when you're arriving in case you have unexpected issues getting into a building or something.

    My son just got admitted to an MS in Computer Science at CMU.
  

    Congratulations to your son!
  

    Trying to scout out some information on housing for him for the fall. I also had a question about which building most of his classes might be in. On Google maps there is one building called ""CMU Computer Science Department"" and another called ""Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science"" at 5000 Forbes Ave. They are shown as near each other, but not the same. Can anyone tell me what the difference is, or would he be likely to have classes in both?
  

    Class location should not factor into housing decisions IMO. The campus is small, and he can get between the buildings that his courses will likely be in (i.e., Gates, Wean, Doherty) in 5 minutes.
  
    IMO, prioritize access to campus via public transportation and access to grocery stores.
  
    Most students live in Squirrel Hill or Shadyside. I prefer living further out in neighborhoods like East Liberty or Highland Park because they're closer to Target, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods (we just lost our Giant Eagle) and still have easy access to campus via 71A/B/C bus lines. To be totally honest, most days I do the 35-minute walk each way to and from campus. The exercise is good for me, it gives me time to catch up with family, and I enjoy seeing the neighborhoods.

    Basically, that question is asking if there's anything about you, your life, your aspirations, or anything else that's changed between your initial application and now.
  
    Let's say you won an award or competition or something this semester, after you submitted your initial application. This would be where you'd put that information. Or, if you had a significant event in your life occur, you could mention that, even if it's something like a death in the family. Be honest and sincere in this case, do not write a pity/sob story. Use common sense.
  
    If there are no significant changes, and you aren't sure what to put, I would recommend looking into some programs that CMU offers, regardless if you qualify or not, and mention something regarding that program. That's horrifically vague, so let me give you some examples.
  
    If you're MCS (Mellon College of Science), CMU has the Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS) which is a pre-college summer 'camp' for high school students. You might not be eligible for that anymore, however, you can mention that it would've been something you wanted to do, and that you'd love to be a TA/Instructor for the course. You could mention something about wishing you had some kind of positive mentor/role model that's relatively close in age to impart crucial knowledge, or something along the lines of that. (Note: Avoid being employed by the university if you can, DM me if you want details)
  
    If you're Electrical & Computer Engineering/School of Computer Science (ECE/SCS), you can mention something about Mill 19 in Hazelwood (borough south of Schenley Park, ~10min drive from campus), which is now the Robotics Innovation Center (RIC). It used to be an abandoned steel mill that basically employed almost the entire neighborhood. When the steel industry left in the 70s, it was essentially abandoned and left the neighborhood in ruin. Only recently has there been improvements in the area, with both the RIC and a huge gang bust that rooted out a major source of crime in the area. CMU ended up buying the Mill 19 property and completely renovated the whole area to be a high tech research center. The 'hangar' roof has a huge array of solar panels, and it's helping bring a lot of people in the area, spending money at local businesses, etc. You can mention how you really like the idea of revitalizing 'abandoned' communities in that manner, converting abandoned and decrepit areas into state-of-the-art facilities, and that you'd like to pursue similar avenues if accepted. Be sure to mention something regarding Pittsburgh historically being a blue collar/steel city which has turned into a medical/tech hub. Here is an article you can reference if you want to go down this route.
  
    If you're design/architecture, you can mention about how you really like the variation in architectural styles and construction methods of campus buildings, and that Pittsburgh's architecture given the hilly landscape really appeals to you.
  
    In general, that prompt is part of what the reviewers will consider when they are stuck between selecting certain applicants. Don't try to be too much of a 'kiss-ass,' just be reasonable.
  
    I think you get the idea now. I know this is a super stressful time for you, but just know that you will never have to deal with this again once you're done. Well, if you're going to grad school, I guess not, but in that case it won't be your first rodeo. It'll never be like this for you again, fortunately. Let me know if you need any more help.

    With your intros and math classes you’ll probably spend most of your time between Doherty and Porter Hall . None of the dorms are really that close but I guess going from Morewood there’s shortcuts through the buildings . West Wing is pretty central . if you had a class first thing in the morning in Posner then Donner or Hamerschlag is closest
  
    Generally most of the offices and some classes sit in these areas:
  
    Mech E in Scaife
  
    ECE in Hamerschlag
  
    BME in Scott
  
    EPP in Wean

    I'm from northeast Ohio and my brother went to Case. I interviewed with and was accepted to Case. To me, Case's campus just seemed very depressing, and you are so far from any part of Cleveland you would want to go to besides University Circle (but don't stray too far from the circle.....). You also have to walk like 10-15 min from the freshman dorms just to get to your classes it seemed like, where that's only true for a single freshman dorm at CMU. My brother lived in Sherman and it and the surrounding dorms seemed worse than Donner is here, and I wasn't really impressed by any of the facilities I saw at Case in general (although the medical buildings do look very nice).
  
    About culture/vibe, I think Case is a little bit different but still more similar to CMU than most other schools would be. Both schools have a high workload and are very interdisciplinary. The big difference would be that Case has pre-law and medical students everywhere, while CMU replaces both cohorts with CS and even more engineering students. If you are interested in CS at all there isn't really a choice between CMU and Case, my brother was a Case CS graduate and is a genius overall but the resources here are unparalleled.
  
    That segues into my next point, a large part of the ""workaholic"" culture at CMU is from CS, ECE, and software related disciplines, and the never-ending discourse about those classes. Non-ECE engineers do have a high workload too but its more in line with other engineering programs I would imagine.
  
    The other main cause of everyone feeling like they are drowning in work is that most students do what it takes to get a B or a C in their classes, while still barely making time to be in 3 clubs, have a minor or 2, have a social life, go to sports practice, etc. The CMU students that don't spend all day studying are extremely driven, engaged and involved with campus life, and thus the workload chafes against that.
  
    TL;DR , make sure to visit both campuses and talk to plenty of students from both schools. Cleveland and Pittsburgh are pretty similar cities but I think Case is located in a much worse spot than CMU is relatively. Overall the schools are pretty similar, and you will have time for other stuff outside of school if you manage time properly (very hard, I can't really do it, its the main lesson of college after all.)

    This is going to be somewhat useless because I don't totally remember where it is, but near one of the elevators on the art levels of Doherty is a fairly useful map of what's going on in each floor of the building. I don't remember whether it's the whole building or just the lower levels, but regardless, it's helpful if you're trying to figure out the maze that is the building.
  


    Like all the Hornbostel buildings [ie the original ones] on campus, if you look up at where the roof meets the exterior walls, there's ceramic detailing that's unique to the building. Once you start paying attention to it, it's a gorgeous little detail of the original campus.
  


    I think I did the same project you're doing now when I was at CMU. Honestly I had a lot of fun just trying to figure out the madness of that building

    Disability services would definitely be my first stop.
  
    No offense intended here, but how can you be sure that living off campus will be better?  Most apartment buildings in Pittsburgh aren't built too differently than the dorms - by which I mean that while you'll get more living space and a kitchen and bathroom to yourself, you'll still be on a floor full of lots of other people and probably between floors of even more.  Plus, many of the buildings near campus will also be full of students who may be equally loud and noisy.
  
    The advantage of staying on campus may be that they can better accommodate your needs.  Be sure to carefully weigh your options. Typically, once you move off campus it's hard to move back on again.

    Don’t live in Oakland. Don’t rent from Lobos.
  
    The two major neighborhoods for unmarried/sociable/not settled down CMU grad students are Squirrel Hill and Shadyside.
  
Squirrel Hill

    Pros: cheaper than shadyside so you get more bang for your buck, affordable Giant Eagle grocery store on the Main Street (Murray Ave), lots of coffee shops and restaurants, a couple good bars, easy bus access to campus. Lots of CMU students live here.
  
    Cons: apartments tend to be older than in Shadyside, depending on where in Squirrel Hill you are (north or south) it’s either a far walk to campus (south) or not near the restaurants/stores (north) though the good bus routes mitigate the long walk issue.
  
    —-
  
Shadyside

    Pros: nicer apartments and fancier neighborhood, short walking distance to grocery stores (Giant Eagle, Market District, Aldi, Whole Foods) but no real grocery stores on the Main Street (Walnut Street), good restaurants, major shopping hub but the shops are bougie, great cafes, lots of grad students, major grad student bars on the Main Street. It’s generally a closer walk to campus and there are also good bus routes.
  
    Cons: expensive, further walk to grocery stores, buses aren’t quite as frequent or easy as squirrel hill but the CMU shuttle mitigates this.
  
    Squirrel hill is loosely divided into SH North and SH South while shadyside has two smaller “main” commercial streets separate from walnut street:
  
    East Shadyside
  


    Main Street: Highland Ave
  


    Highlights: great restaurants and cafes, giant eagle is super close, cheaper, can walk to Bakery Square / Trader Joes
  


    drawback: further from campus (but good shuttle access)
  


    Shadyside Gayborhood
  


    Main Street: Ellsworth Ave just east of Negley
  


    highlights: local gayborhood, notable bars/restaurants/ cafe, close to negley bus routes, can easily walk to walnut St, highland, Whole Foods, and east liberty
  


    drawbacks: can be expensive, older residents and fewer students, nightlife is almost exclusively gay
  


    —-
  
    Both shadyside and squirrel hill are extremely walkable, have fun cultural/neighborhood events, and solid grad student populations. You’ll definitely live near lots of your classmates if you live in either of these neighborhoods.
  
    Other notable neighborhoods are Bloomfield, Garfield, friendship, east liberty, point breeze, wilkinsburg, and regents square, but from your list of desirable features you should probably limit your search to SH or shadyside. Maybe east liberty which has some incredible new restaurants and bars right across the train tracks from E Shadyside. The Target is in East Liberty.
  
    —-
  
Honorable Mention: Bakery Square

    Maybe take a look at bakery square if you want a newer large community of young professionals and CMU students. The only landlord is Walnut Capital who developed the whole neighborhood. The Trader Joe’s and Google offices are here and some nice shops and restaurants are opening up in the new development. It’s further away but there are lots of students and nice amenities.
  
    —-
  
    Side note for big budgets and people who want to live in fancy new developments with great amenities:
  
    The new bougie/upscale apartment buildings (Ollie Baumhaus, East Side Bond, etc) are across the train tracks so they’re technically in East Liberty, but I’d consider them to be shadyside-adjacent. They’re closer to grocery stores but further from campus and have more young professionals than grad students. they’re close enough to shadyside, east shadyside, the gayborhood, and east liberty that they’re walkable and social.
  
    —
  Edit for the non-bougie just looking for a good apartment in a good neighborhood and NOT having luck in squirrel hill / shadyside
    There are other great neighborhoods that other students overlook
  


    Friendship - fantastic neighborhood. One of my faves. Great deals on gorgeous, spacious apartments in converted mansions. Low-key vibe. Walkable to shadyside, east liberty, and a cool gentrifying neighborhood called Garfield.
  


    east liberty - this is a very diverse neighborhood in terms of residents and types of housing. It’s a historically black neighborhood that is gentrifying and has the fanciest apartment buildings near campus (e.g. east side bond and Ollie). It has the best grocery stores. If you live here, keep in mind that buses to campus aren’t as good and you’ll be happier the closer to the zone between the target and the whole foods you live. Further north it’s less student-y.
  


    point breeze - similar location to Bakery Square or N Squirrel Hill. Very quiet and residential. Lovely apartments in homes converted to 2-3 apartment units. Cute central area with a cafe and a restaurant. Walkable to shadyside and bakery square.
  


    regent square - this is a little further out so if you have a car, it’s doable. Buses are pretty good. Much less expensive. Great for late-stage grad students and couples. Cute Main Street with good restaurants.

    There's some pretty good scenery, schenly is right across from campus and it's really nice. Campus is definitely a mix between modern and dated buildings, but the dated ones aren't that bad.
  
    It rains a lot occasionally and Pittsburgh is the cloudiest city in the US, but we have some really nice days.

    Hello! Like another commenter I also had to choose between CMU and Cornell. One of my friends had the same choice too. He said this and I agree: When he visited Cornell, he felt like a lot of CS majors there said something along the lines of “I switched to it because everyone started to switch” or “It makes good money” kinda vibes - which are valid reasons. But at CMU, he felt like he could go up to anyone and start talking to them. I think so too - one of them immediate things I noticed was CMU students’ passion about their majors. This is outside of SCS as well. I think it may be due to how students are admitted (you’re accepted into a specific school, and specifically for CS, everyone in SCS usually got in without transferring). It was honestly so inspiring to see the passion everyone had. I know CivE/EPP majors so passionate about designing buildings and helping the environment, I know a Physics major who goes to his Physics professor’s office hours just to have lunch with him and talk about Formula 1, and I know a ChemE major actually ENJOYING his organic chemistry classes. Art majors have excitedly shown me their art, and an English major I know loves to rave about her English classes (and how much more boring stem classes are in her opinion!) Sitting at La Prima (coffee shop at cmu), I’ve overheard many drama majors talking excitedly about their upcoming plays or performances. I’m in All University Orchestra, so I also know music majors are passionate as well. Can you tell I’m inspired by passion! I could go on and on. Man I love this place.
  
    CMU students work hard because their hearts are in the work. You can work as hard or as little as you want. I do wanna note though, the first semester was the hardest (at least for me) since I had to adjust from high school to a college like cmu. It gets progressively easier though. I recently planned out my classes for the next 2 years and by senior year, I’ll be chilling!
  
    Plus, you can really do exactly what you like with CS here. There’s a wider variety of classes offered, and many majors to choose from (classic CS, AI, Comp Bio, human computer interactions) plus many additional majors & concentrations (robotics, systems, software engineering, machine learning, etc...). Cornell’s CS is very good (the best out of all the Ivy’s, actually) but nowhere can really compete with the breadth of CS courses that CMU offers.
  
    I know this isn’t what you asked for but the city of Pittsburgh just far surpasses Cornell’s area. You won’t be able to get the same vibes and food, or meet other people who are not from your school.
  
    These are just my experiences though. Feel free to DM me, I know lots about both Cornell and CMU. (got into Cornell Engineering/CMU SCS) good luck on whatever you choose! :)

    These are some early drawings of campus buildings done by the architect Henry Hornbostel. Hornbostel, the first architect for Carnegie Mellon, was famous in his day for the beauty of his perspective drawings.
  
    The first picture is most recognizable as an early idea for (what would later be called) Hamerschlag Hall. Note the original conception interfaced with the railway in Junction Hollow.
  
    The second picture is (I think!) where Hunt Library now stands. Since Frew Street was originally the primary road interface to campus, a monumental entrance was planned between Baker and the College of Fine Arts.
  
    The third picture is looking down Margaret Morrison St. You can see how the building on the right is the back of CFA, which looks relatively similar to how it does today. Between the two buildings, another monumental entrance has been planned, which connects to the monumental entrance in Picture 2. (The left building is the profile of the building in Profile 2.)
  
    These plans were adapted over time, but overall Hornbostel was successful in realizing his plans, except for some of the more flashier elements. Later, he had planned an eight story dining hall/administrative building for where Hunt Library is, but the plan was never realized due to world events. (Great Depression, etc.)
  
    This is part of my capstone research. If you're interested in learning more, I'll be giving another architectural history tour this Wednesday at 4:00pm. We'll be meeting directly in front of the entrance of CFA.

    I was in Mudge Freshman year, had a room in the basement, hot water pipes went through it so we never needed to turn on the heater, though it was decently cool in the summer.
  
    I'm pretty sure Mudge is winning the freshman dorm lottery. You're about as close to campus as you can be while still having a private-ish bathroom, you have a small gym, you have a cool yard and some common areas.
  
    Your bathroom situation is two rooms sharing one bathroom between them in a ""suite"". So you effectively have one roommate plus two suitemates from the other room. You can close the door to the suite separately from the doors to the two rooms and it's kind of like you have one big room (though obviously the RA is going to encourage keeping doors open most of the time).
  
    One thing that's weird about Mudge is the house itself and the two buildings that house most of the rooms are actually separate. You either have to walk through the courtyard or through the connected basement to get to your room (unless you get lucky and get one of the big rooms in the main house).

    Yep! I didn't know I was going to do a CS major, until I really liked a class I took. I talked to my advisor about it, and just added the curriculum for a double major to my plan online. I was then able to see all the classes I needed to take.
  
    I had a friend who used to live on Rez on Fifth. He said he really didn't like it because it's pretty far away, but he also said he didn't know anybody and didn't like his roommates. It's not really that far away, probably like an average 12 minute walk? If you want to take full advantage of a kitchen though, it might be your best bet.
  
    As for the scooter, it's totally up to you. A lot of people use bikes to get to campus or the hover boards or whatever they're called. You wouldn't be out of place but why? It's such a small campus, usually it'll just be small walks between buildings. With a scooter, you'd have to find, then lock it to the nearest rack, pick it up afterwards, tote it with you if you're walking with a friend, etc.. It's up to you but it seems more like an inconvenience to me if you just want to use to get around campus.

    A huge difference between the schools is that one is public, with a ton of students and limited state funding, while the other is private, and each student pays $55k for tuition. If you're paying that much for your education, it's a huge business transaction. You are paying $$$ for that educational product. You and the school are going to work to get your money's worth, right? At a public school, its more like, ""Ok, you paid $13k in tuition. So did all 6k other freshmen. Get in line."" It's not literally like this, as in, nobody is going to talk down to you like this or not try to help you. It's just the reality of the situation. Life is like this too, however, so in a sense it's not a bad thing. I just bet it's a little nicer at private school, where they are literally indebted to serve you in exchange for your whopping tuition bill. I didn't go to a private college, so I could be speaking out of my ass here, but I am just assuming things are nicer simply because the state doesn't have to pay for it.
  
    At Berkeley, they ran out of housing options one year and had to send students to San Franciso or Oakland to stay in other universities' dorms. I mean, that kind of thing would not fly at a private institution. I don't know if that is still happening (they just built a brand new dorm maybe 2 years ago), but my point is that you just have to concede some things because it's a public institution. Some buildings are old as shit with desks and chalkboards from the 50s. Some are brand new and beautiful. (Hell, maybe that's true for CMU too?) Some majors have a lot of advisors who are very available and very friendly. Some majors have fewer advisors. Some majors (CS) have rich donors. Other majors have much, much less rich alumni who can't afford such big donations. Anyways, in addition to that stuff, there are just somethings like  ""classes are huge, grades are curved low, deal with it"" that you get from a public school that I kinda feel wouldn't cause stress at a private university. I don't know about CMU, but we always lamented how Stanford had a significantly higher average GPA. Maybe that's not true for CMU, I'm not sure.

    Mudge A Tower is great, but there’s a lot of variation between the quality of the rooms because the building wasn’t built to be a dorm. For example, one of the doubles I have been in has its own bathroom, but most don’t. They also vary in size.
  
    I’m still close with friends from Mudge A Tower and I graduated over 10 years ago.

    Congrats on two amazing opportunities :) I was torn between essentially the same two options (USC presidential scholarship/viterbi scholar vs. CMU SCS at full price) and had similar pros/cons!
  
    I ended up choosing CMU because of academic rigor, student culture, and job outcomes/opportunities, and having graduated a few years ago, I would make that decision again in a heartbeat. CMU was extremely challenging for me, but it helped me build a strong technical foundation and has prepared me for every challenge I've faced in my career so far.
  
    Stress/burnout is a valid concern. I do feel like a lot of the stress culture is self-inflicted, in the sense that, when you're surrounded by really passionate individuals doing cool things, you feel pressured to push yourself too. Different people handle it differently, but I rarely felt like it was competitive or cutthroat. I loved how enthusiastic everyone was about learning and how CMU culture had such an academic focus (which I felt like USC did not). In terms of my life outside of my schoolwork, I participated in a lot of activities/clubs and met people from all over the world.
  
    I only took one robotics class, so can't speak to that directly, but I had several friends who did and all had amazing robotics experiences at CMU. Some of them did additional majors in robotics, and a lot of them got hands-on experience in research labs early on in their undergraduate career.

    Thank you so much for your thoroughness! I'm in AP Physics C right now, and I took multivariable calculus outside of school during the Fall semester, so it sounds like our backgrounds are very similar! In that case I think I'd try to take Matter and Interactions as it definitely sounds worth it and hopefully I'd be able to handle it. Your original comment said there were two notable exceptions to the more manageable classes, which I forgot to ask about--which ones were those, out of curiosity?
  
    As for research, nice to know that professors are open to it with students. It's definitely something I want to try doing, I think it'd be important experience for me and would probably help in building a resume for grad school as well.
  
    A few other questions I didn't mention in my original comment--about how many Physics undergrads are there at CMU? I've heard the department is pretty small compared to others like CS/Engineering; would you say this is a positive or a negative?
  
    Also--you mentioned taking Math/CS classes. Are there any of those that you'd suggest taking as a Physics major? And do you think it's worth taking a minor or double majoring in Math, CS or Engineering? This isn't really something I've decided yet but something I think I'd want to look into.
  
    One more question... anything in particular that made you pick CMU? I also have acceptances from UCLA and UIUC, and am waiting on quite a few more, so I'm trying to decide between those right now. Based on what you've told me and what I've read CMU is my top option right now, but I'm curious if you also picked CMU over other schools and had a particular reason for doing so.

    I'm between colleges Dietrich and Tepper and haven't noticed any animosity between any of the colleges.

    You only seem to have observed half the picture. I personally do not believe CMU's main objective is to be teaching you contents of the course. In their eyes you can always learn by simply googling a topic and besides, technology gets outdated, the methods of today are not the method of yesterday. The main philosophy they're trying to teach is that you will get it done regardless whether or not you understand the material in one way or another. This school is a breeding ground for workhorses ""I will get things done, no matter the circumstances"".
  
    This is why a lot of the times things are inefficient and incredibly hard for no reason. Also why the professors are shit at teaching, and why they don't allow you any time to absorb the material.
  
    I personally have noticed that most people here are not smart, but they are simply hard-working. People come up with their own ways to beat this system, some might be friends with incredibly smart people (which are the minority), others stay up all night, trying to grasp simple concepts. Some sleep with their TA's and others cheat (a good population of people do this but never tell you) which I personally think is OK because CMU does not punish you for cheating but they punish you if you are caught cheating.
  
    How you end up surviving is up to you.

    Freshman here. TL;DR, construct situations to talk with people and do things with them, and build from there. I did this with floormates and clubmates.
  
    I feel a bit weird putting it to words like this, but I practiced inserting myself into people’s activities, until I found a group that clicks really well.
  
    We all did events to recognize each other during Oweek. Leveraging that, i eventually figured out the names, or at least BS’d my way through not knowing the names of, a bunch of people in my dorm.
  
    I ALWAYS ask what people are up to. What they’re studying; and if so, how they feel abt that upcoming test or getting them to explain the interesting side of the work. What they’re wearing, especially pins and other merch that can spark a media related convo. And ESPECIALLY, if they’re off somewhere, where they’re off to. This last one is crucial.
  
    If it’s an exclusive event somehow, that’s fine - it will be clear in the tone. It is at least an opportunity to know something more about what they do, and offer them personally tailored good-wishes. (It makes a conversation starter next you see them - bonding is cumulative, and for me, conversation is eternal)
  
    But, if it’s something casual, or goofy, or plain old taking care of their student necessities (getting lunch, picking up packages), then A) you can also tell by tone, and B) people are VERY willing to have you come along. Make the effort, even (especially) if not explicitly invited, to casually work in the question of if you could join. If they’re iffy, don’t press it, but I assure you it will work.
  
    Sometimes that stuff is simple and rote, but still enjoyable. Getting lunch or waiting in line or even walking towards a same direction is a nice change of pace from solo. But sometimes, precious few memorable times, you will hit a jackpot. My closest friends here have come from hitting a group of people off to do the randomest big thing, like a midnight movie or a giant friend-group lunch meet, and I popped along and met some of my new favorite people.
  
    I think you’ve gotta find good friends who match your wavelength first. Close friends come with time and shared proximity. But to get a seed planted, try the above. You’ll do alright.

    You are not stupid, you are overwhelmed by a workload you have never experienced before. Adjusting will take time. Growing hurts.
  


    As hard as it might seem, try not to let the fear of future semesters drag you down. Yes, that upper level will be hard, but you will be older, smarter, and better when you get there compared to who you are today. One of my biggest regrets was obsessing over future courses while ignoring my current courses.
  


    Feeling like you’re years behind academically will hurt, but know that imposter syndrome is inevitable at a place like CMU. Maybe the 16 year old who graduated high school early and is bored taking math studies their freshman fall won’t have that kind of problem, but they’re the anomaly - no matter how dumb you want to believe yourself to be, you made it into CMU, and that’s an accomplishment not many can do. It is ok to feel like you’re lacking compared to others: you will have more to learn than them, and will grow more as a result.
  


    It may or may not get better. CMU is notoriously difficult, with a stress culture that admin doesn’t like admitting to, which makes staying above water seem impossible. I had a rough go at it (Covid derailed my plans, and substance abuse set me back a year) but not once did I doubt my ability to graduate. Yes, I thought about quitting all the time - but the only possible barrier I faced to finishing was always myself. Become your best friend, not your own worst enemy. Take control of what you can and worry not about what you cannot, and soon enough you’ll have graduated.
  


    Another note: if you aren’t happy or passionate with what you’re doing, it’s okay to consider a major/career switch. You’re only hurting yourself by staying in a program that clearly isn’t for you. Also, therapy is worth it. You got this.

how to get to,,"

    Here’s my take:
  
    I would say clubs are not necessary to land a job and a recruiter probably wouldn’t think twice about you having a bunch of projects and work experience rather than clubs.
  
    With that being said, I would highly discourage just avoiding them altogether. Here are some reasons
  


    larger clubs will sometimes bring in sponsors for recruiting events, and in these cases the sponsors are coming specifically to recruit from your club essentially. This is a massive advantage over something like the career fair, where you are competing with hundreds of other interested people. I know the main club I am in has multiple sponsor events a semester and it’s very common for some club members to end up at those companies
  


    Clubs are a great starting place for many interview questions. You know, the common ones like “describe a time where you worked as a team” or “describe a time when something went wrong” etc. I found myself almost always referring back to a club experience for all of these questions
  


    Mental health. CMU can feel like a “grindy” school if all you do is just classwork. That’s sort of what I felt like my freshman year (Covid made it hard to really be in any clubs). But as soon as I started just scheduling clubs and activities into my day I was pretty amazed with just how much better I felt mentally but also with just how much time I actually had available. Those mental breaks are super important and I found let me work more productivity.
  


    My personal best experience has been roboclub. This isn’t an ad for roboclub, it’s just what I have experience with and I’m sure there’s other clubs with similar philosophies. The thing with roboclub is that it’s not any sort of big time commitment. It’s just a place you show up to work on random fun projects, get supplies for a project, or just do homework/talk. Some weeks I find myself there for like 6 hours a day to socialized/work because I’m not too busy, but some weeks I may barely go in. It’s just a stress free place to hang out and it only ever takes up as much time as you are able to put in.
  
    I’ll reiterate one thing just because it’s probably the biggest thing I got out of my undergrad here in terms of time management: Just put things on your calendar that you think are fun. I thought I had no time, and then my sophomore year ended up doing 4 clubs very actively and honestly felt so much better. I didn’t really feel that much more pressure with workload, it just helped me more efficiently use my time and not waste it being depressed.

    i do everything myself
  

    This is probably your main issue.
  
    Get study groups in every course.  Your friend group should be basically all taking the same courses as you go through. And you should make certain keep taking the same courses as the majority of your friend group.
  
    Once you get off that cadence then it is rough lands.
  
    Good peer pressure is key.
  

    I knew I was going to have to work harder if i decided to come here but i dont have time for anything at all.
  

    More than likely you have terrible time management.   This is a skill not taught really.
  
    Also, you need to learn that getting an A+ in every class isn't always the goal.  Sometimes you need to not put in 30 more hours for that A+, but be ok with an A because you just got 30 hours to spend on other courses to get the grade there to a B+ or A- (i.e. time/life is zero sum).
  
    As other posts have said, you MUST attend all TA Sessions / Office hours / etc.   Put them into your calendar.  Go there and work on your homework.   If you can't work in such a setting, then going there will help you learn to do so.  Even the smartest godlike people will hit a wall at some point and you need to know how to get help instead of using your one ""I can miss an assignment and not be penalized by it"" token and then have that concept show up on the midterm and final and lose points from it because you were like:  ""I don't get this and I can skip it for free.""    VS  suck it up and be at every TA session no matter what.
  
    Also speak with your advisor.   They probably have other ""people like you"" and can hook you up to form your own study group.

    It gets much easier once you have more established friendships and social circles, and once you acclimate to the workload and figure out how to manage it. My biggest tip would be to not be afraid to ask for help — course resources like office hours and Piazza exist for a reason, and many of your classmates probably feel the same way you do and would love a new friend to study with. Also, you can always wait to join extracurriculars until you’re feeling less overwhelmed. Good luck, hope things get better for you!!

    Is it free money when he is basically just refunding taxes already paid?
  
    Starlink started ten years ago.  How come Trump or republicans didn't pass any infrastructure investment when they had the chance?  They snoozed so they lose.
  
    I'm not arguing the government doesn't have flaws but to pretend the private sector doesn't make a boat load of mistakes as well is just head in the sand.  Yes the free market can do great things with competition but it also creates a lot of duplication which is waste as well.  Both systems are flawed but you just chose to ignore the flaws in one and obsess about the flaws in the other.
  
    Democrats aren't just giving money to donors - they are investing in future industries so the country can compete in the global economy.  Republicans just give handouts to oil and gas and are letting the innovation economy languish which their buddies get rich raping our natural resources.

    No it isn’t... By your logic, a flat tax of 70% on everyone is more progressive than any other country in the world...
  

    No.  My point is to look at several factors including the top rate instead of cherry picking one statistic that masks income inequality
  

    How many of those states were controlled by Democrats for 100+ years?
  

    That has got to be the stupidest thing you have said.  Those states haven’t been controlled by democrats in over fifty years.  The party names of the past are meaningless and generally most of the policies have flipped between the parties in the 60s
  

    More so a white/black thing than a politics thing.  Black women tend to have more pre-existing conditions and are more likely to have certain pregnancy related illnesses like preeclampsia.
  

    Interesting you bring that up after I pointed out replican states but not before you trashed nyc which has a highwr than average minority population
  
    Many republican states have a steep cliff where benefits drop to zero at around $20k for a mother with one child. Thats a full time job earning $9.60 an hour
  

    Full time jobs offer health insurance
  

    Says who?  There is a penalty if they don’t but it is usually cheaper to pay the penalty than provide insurance.  And it only applies to large employers with more than fifty employees.  Many just only hire part time people anyway. A mother can work fifty hours a week at two part time jobs earning $9 and hour and not qualify for any health insurance assistance
  

    Not to mention there are still free clinics,
  

    Those are a drop in the bucket compared to the need for services and provide very basic care.  Most of those are government funded so basically socialized healthcare and the brainchild of Bernie sanders who has singlehanded secured their funding year after year
  

    and every single hospital system has charity care when people who make less than 100%-200% of the poverty line pay little to nothing.
  

    Did you just pull that out of your butt or do you have sources?  Hospitals donate bare minimum care just to stabilize and then kick people out. They still bill these people for as much as they think can get without pushing them into bankruptcy which makes it harder to collect.

    Still doesn’t make us the highest rate.
  

    I never said the US had the highest rate...
  

    But it is relevant when you claim we are the most progressive.
  

    Even accounting for that the US is more Progressive.
  

    Thats one statistic of progressiveness but prone to misleading conclusions.  it doesn’t entirely take into account the wider gap between rich and poor here compared to Europe.  We have higher levels of extreme poverty and extreme wealth and that will skew the share of income tax paid by wealthy
  

    Yet they have double the US average Maternal Death rate...
  

    NYC welcomes poor, minorities and immigrants  with open arms without worrying that it will bring down their statistics.  Democrats controlled states have much better maternal mortality stats than Republican states by far.
  

    And we kick them off health insurance when the baby is one year old. 
  

https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-postpartum-coverage-extension-tracker/

    Is up to the individual states for how much they cover.  Many republicans states cap it at one year including Texas and Florida and   have strict income limits and a draconian benefits cliff while other states have gradual decrease in subsidies.
  

    They can still buy their own insurance after a year..
  

    They can but it isn’t remotely feasible for poor mothers to do so.
  

    Many also still qualify for Medicaid under income  thresholds.
  

    Many republican states have a steep cliff where benefits drop to zero at around $20k for a mother with one child.  Thats a full time job earning $9.60 an hour.  If she earns ten dollars an hour they get no health insurance!  It basically makes woman completely screwed if the father walks out in  them because there is no way for them to work to buy their own insurance and afford child care.
  

    Hardly no one... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_New_Deal#Supporters


    That is 13 out of 51 democratic senators.  Regardless, there is a big difference between generally supporting the broad strokes of a policy paper and actually voting for a specific law.

I don’t understand why you are even bothering defending such a weak argument on this isssue….
  
"

    What is your source on that?  Many countries in Europe have top rates over 50%.  Anyway, capital gains, carried interest and pass through income allow many rich people to avoid income tax in the U.S.  But regardless of how progressive the tax code is, that’s despite republicans efforts to get the rates lower.  And yet we still manage to fail at helping mothers.  We have some of the least health care access for mothers after birth, we have near zero after school and summer child care, no paid leave after birth, and the list goes on and on.  Good news is we have enough fighter jets and nuclear bombs to destroy the whole world.  Let’s get into how much of a failure and waste of money so many defense project are like the f22, f35, littoral combat ships. Look at those if you are wondering where all the tax money has gone.  Yet Republicans don’t skip a beat at throwing money down the drain at these programs bc it’s their donors who benefit.  Meanwhile you are upset that the government is trying to expand electric cars and clean up the air so we don’t have embarrassingly high levels of childhood asthma in poor neighborhoods.   To me, the obsession with abortion smells like a power grab and quest for control and not a genuine concern for babies and children

    It's a cost/benefit analysis thing.

    Do your thoughts change if you're working while at school (in the community, not just a campus job)?
  
    Do they change if you're involved in politics while at school? (I do in fact know people who became elected officials where they attended college).
  
    How about if you don't go to college immediately after high school, so attend college after living somewhere other than with your parents (but are in your location for college only, not work)? Is your ""home state"" still where your parents live, even though you didn't move directly from there and regardless of your age?
  
    What about grad students? Do they count differently?
  
    Basically, what is allowed to factor into whether something is considered your ""home state""? Since becoming eligible to vote, I've spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state, and more time in Pittsburgh than any other city. Why do you consider that ""tourism"" but not my short stint in the city where I got a 3-month lease -- just because I was working rather than studying in the second scenario?

    I'm currently a high school senior in the Bay Area and I am considering applying Early Decision to CMU (School of Computer Science)! I was on campus last summer for one of their pre-college programs and I thought it was nice. Of course, I wasn't able to experience the student life as the students were on vacation.
  
    I loved everything about CMU, but when I searched up the social life, dating life, party life, etc online, it seemed that everything was kind of on the down low. Is it really that dead? Being from the bay area, there's usually a party to go to every weekend and a lot of opportunities in terms of social and dating life. I don't expect it to be the same or anything, but how dead really is it? Is everyone really studious and they don't have time for social/dating lives, or is that just a certain group of people? How hard is it to find people open to dating & having fun over the weekends? And I know that the campus is very connected to the UPitt campus.. does that make a difference?
  
    My school is also pretty big in terms of high schools, and I know that CMU is considered a small college, but how small is it really? How many people are in each class and do I only see people who I have already met on campus?
  
    I know that there are chances where I won't even get in, because CMU is, of course, one of the best schools in the country, especially for majors in SCS, but I was just wondering about the non-academic life at CMU before I lock in my ED Application, so please let me know :)

    You have it a bit backwards on funding cause and effect, but the net outcome is the same.
  
    Us news rankings are heavily weighted on funding divided by tenure faculty, so more funding (with same tenure count) tends to increase your ranking. Better rankings tend to mean you can hire more competitive faculty, which tend to write better proposals.
  
    Federal agencies care little how much funding any one university gets directly.

    Freshman here. TL;DR, construct situations to talk with people and do things with them, and build from there. I did this with floormates and clubmates.
  
    I feel a bit weird putting it to words like this, but I practiced inserting myself into people’s activities, until I found a group that clicks really well.
  
    We all did events to recognize each other during Oweek. Leveraging that, i eventually figured out the names, or at least BS’d my way through not knowing the names of, a bunch of people in my dorm.
  
    I ALWAYS ask what people are up to. What they’re studying; and if so, how they feel abt that upcoming test or getting them to explain the interesting side of the work. What they’re wearing, especially pins and other merch that can spark a media related convo. And ESPECIALLY, if they’re off somewhere, where they’re off to. This last one is crucial.
  
    If it’s an exclusive event somehow, that’s fine - it will be clear in the tone. It is at least an opportunity to know something more about what they do, and offer them personally tailored good-wishes. (It makes a conversation starter next you see them - bonding is cumulative, and for me, conversation is eternal)
  
    But, if it’s something casual, or goofy, or plain old taking care of their student necessities (getting lunch, picking up packages), then A) you can also tell by tone, and B) people are VERY willing to have you come along. Make the effort, even (especially) if not explicitly invited, to casually work in the question of if you could join. If they’re iffy, don’t press it, but I assure you it will work.
  
    Sometimes that stuff is simple and rote, but still enjoyable. Getting lunch or waiting in line or even walking towards a same direction is a nice change of pace from solo. But sometimes, precious few memorable times, you will hit a jackpot. My closest friends here have come from hitting a group of people off to do the randomest big thing, like a midnight movie or a giant friend-group lunch meet, and I popped along and met some of my new favorite people.
  
    I think you’ve gotta find good friends who match your wavelength first. Close friends come with time and shared proximity. But to get a seed planted, try the above. You’ll do alright.

    Here’s my take:
  
    I would say clubs are not necessary to land a job and a recruiter probably wouldn’t think twice about you having a bunch of projects and work experience rather than clubs.
  
    With that being said, I would highly discourage just avoiding them altogether. Here are some reasons
  


    larger clubs will sometimes bring in sponsors for recruiting events, and in these cases the sponsors are coming specifically to recruit from your club essentially. This is a massive advantage over something like the career fair, where you are competing with hundreds of other interested people. I know the main club I am in has multiple sponsor events a semester and it’s very common for some club members to end up at those companies
  


    Clubs are a great starting place for many interview questions. You know, the common ones like “describe a time where you worked as a team” or “describe a time when something went wrong” etc. I found myself almost always referring back to a club experience for all of these questions
  


    Mental health. CMU can feel like a “grindy” school if all you do is just classwork. That’s sort of what I felt like my freshman year (Covid made it hard to really be in any clubs). But as soon as I started just scheduling clubs and activities into my day I was pretty amazed with just how much better I felt mentally but also with just how much time I actually had available. Those mental breaks are super important and I found let me work more productivity.
  


    My personal best experience has been roboclub. This isn’t an ad for roboclub, it’s just what I have experience with and I’m sure there’s other clubs with similar philosophies. The thing with roboclub is that it’s not any sort of big time commitment. It’s just a place you show up to work on random fun projects, get supplies for a project, or just do homework/talk. Some weeks I find myself there for like 6 hours a day to socialized/work because I’m not too busy, but some weeks I may barely go in. It’s just a stress free place to hang out and it only ever takes up as much time as you are able to put in.
  
    I’ll reiterate one thing just because it’s probably the biggest thing I got out of my undergrad here in terms of time management: Just put things on your calendar that you think are fun. I thought I had no time, and then my sophomore year ended up doing 4 clubs very actively and honestly felt so much better. I didn’t really feel that much more pressure with workload, it just helped me more efficiently use my time and not waste it being depressed.

    i do everything myself
  

    This is probably your main issue.
  
    Get study groups in every course.  Your friend group should be basically all taking the same courses as you go through. And you should make certain keep taking the same courses as the majority of your friend group.
  
    Once you get off that cadence then it is rough lands.
  
    Good peer pressure is key.
  

    I knew I was going to have to work harder if i decided to come here but i dont have time for anything at all.
  

    More than likely you have terrible time management.   This is a skill not taught really.
  
    Also, you need to learn that getting an A+ in every class isn't always the goal.  Sometimes you need to not put in 30 more hours for that A+, but be ok with an A because you just got 30 hours to spend on other courses to get the grade there to a B+ or A- (i.e. time/life is zero sum).
  
    As other posts have said, you MUST attend all TA Sessions / Office hours / etc.   Put them into your calendar.  Go there and work on your homework.   If you can't work in such a setting, then going there will help you learn to do so.  Even the smartest godlike people will hit a wall at some point and you need to know how to get help instead of using your one ""I can miss an assignment and not be penalized by it"" token and then have that concept show up on the midterm and final and lose points from it because you were like:  ""I don't get this and I can skip it for free.""    VS  suck it up and be at every TA session no matter what.
  
    Also speak with your advisor.   They probably have other ""people like you"" and can hook you up to form your own study group.

    You can apply to PhD straight from undergrad in the US, but getting into cmu specifically is hard (HCI PhD acceptance rate was 5% last year).
  
    To estimate your chances, you can look up the profiles of first-year PhD students and see how yours compare to them (typically they will have public personal websites that include their publications). Note that the number of first-authored papers is more important than the number of papers. Overall, make sure to apply to a wide range of schools instead of only cmu. csrankings.org is a good tool to identify schools and professors in your area.

    I'm a rising high school senior considering applying ED to CMU for either CS or mathematical sciences. For some reason, information about what the culture at CMU is like has been hard to find. Is it very academic/ study-driven? Is everyone exceptionally smart? I personally prefer a more academic environment and would love to be surrounded by lots of smart people passionate about what they're doing than more of a party culture.
  
    Also, this is kinda unrelated but according to the CMU website, the average salary on graduation seems exceptionally high, particularly for math majors. Is that really so, or is there some caveat here?
  
    Another thing I wanted to know was the easy of double majoring with CS. How doable is it?
  
    And lastly, did anyone get into CS program here (computational biology or AI) without significant CS related ECs? I'm from more of a math background, and have a pretty scattered profile overall, and was wondering if I have a chance at CMU SCS in case I ED.

    I’m gonna ramble a bit because I’m in a long car ride and have nothing to do, but I hope it’s at least a little helpful. Also, disclaimer that im a physics and CS major so a lot of this applies to CS/science and might not be true for humanities, theatre, etc.
  


    Cmu has a reputation for being intense but realistically for CS it takes as much time as you put in. If you have the same high minded approach to CS and must have a 4.0, it’ll suck up an unhealthy amount of time. If you prioritize a balanced life and learning what you want, you can definitely keep it at ~40 hrs/week of schoolwork (after the first year). Classes are generally harder and more time consuming than other schools, and a lot of people get stuck in nonstop work, but you can (and IMO should) avoid it by figuring out what your priorities are and being willing to trade perfect grades for sleep or socializing. For reference, I’m doing cs as an additional major so I’m at nonstop work with 2 majors, but that’s fully something I’ve chosen and I’m doing it with classes I enjoy. I really like TAing so that’s my main extracurricular, and most nights I’m either working with friends or gaming.
  


    I’m not sure what you mean exactly by managing projects, but any managing of large code projects I’ve done in classes has been because there’s so much code to write that it needed management. Systems classes have this the most with big projects that require writing multiple files of code and careful debugging and git usage to keep track of things. Other classes may focus more on theoretical concepts but there’s still always a programming component where you come up with implementations and write code.
  
    2. I don’t know much about theater, but it there are clubs like scotch and soda that you can do. As far as a major or minor, I’d recommend looking at the website or emailing an advisor.
  
    3. The work culture is definitely unique in a bad way. Part of it is classes that take themselves way too seriously, but I think a bigger part is that cmu just has a lot of people who are quick to sacrifice sleep and happiness to do work, which can sometimes make you feel like the outlier for prioritizing other things that make you happy. Majors like math and cs also tend to have more advanced classes (upperclass math classes are generally at the level of graduate math classes at other schools).
  
    That being said, there’s also a lot of emphasis at cmu that I haven’t seen from other schools my friends go to on exploring and learning things you find interesting, no matter how niche or theoretical. You can find courses and professors for just about every niche subfield and people generally enjoy this, so it can be a really fun learning environment.
  
    4. I mainly chose between Georgia tech and cmu. I went with cmu because I liked the calm, smaller school vibe. Pittsburgh is pretty calm and quiet for a city, especially around cmu, but still with fun stuff to do. I also liked that cmu is pretty small and quiet, but Pitt is right next door and I have friends there from high school that I can go out with when I occasionally want a bigger school vibe. I’d encourage strongly considering the lifestyle and environment of a school because unlike high school, you live at your college. Classes will always have ups and downs, but the city and lifestyle will ultimately determine if you enjoy life at college or not.
  
    5. Best part is definitely all the friends I have and getting to take classes I really enjoy. People at cmu are almost all really excited and invested in learning whatever their chosen field is, and that vibe keeps me motivated and excited to learn even when the work gets overwhelming. I hate when college apps ask about your passion, but in this case if you’re passionate about learning, cmu will serve you well. I also just really like Pittsburgh for the reasons above.
  
    The worst part is the overwhelming work I mentioned. Most of the student body is also overworked, which can get really rough when everyone around you is stressed and none of your friends have time to do fun things. I’m overworked because I’d rather be a little tired than drop one of my majors or TAing, but a lot of people are overworked for no particular reason, which isn’t a healthy vibe to be around. I think you have to be a little strong willed about prioritizing what’s important to you and not letting others affect your opinion of if you’re doing enough, because it’s impossible to feel like you’re doing enough if you’re comparing yourself to people at cmu.
  
    It’s easy to have a really rough time at cmu, so I think it’s especially important that it’s a good fit for you as a person and student. If it is though, you’ll thrive with opportunities for both learning and your career that are very hard to find elsewhere.

    Low key doxxing myself but I'm from northern NJ, am also Pakistani-American male
  
    Also, how are scholarships and money given by CMU? How can I increase the scholarship amount? Thanks!

    Hi! I'm a HS senior applying to CMU. Who's your favorite CMU professor for Electrical Engineering, and how did they help you learn/grow? In your experience, what sets Electrical Engineering at CMU apart from, say, Cornell, Georgia Tech, or Vanderbilt?
  
    I really like what I see about CMU and would love to get information that only electrical engineers at the university would know.
  
    Thanks!

    I think there are some factors that you might not notice until you start at school. When you register you won’t always get the classes you want. This is especially common with CS core classes as a non-major which takes away some of the wiggle room. This means you’ll have to scramble last minute to find replacement classes when you don’t get into what you want.
  
    Honestly though I wouldn’t worry about this stuff too much. When I started freshman year I was doing the same thing as you, planning out how to cram in all sorts of double majors and dual degrees in spreadsheets. It’s very likely you’ll change your interests when you start at CMU (which isn’t a bad thing at all 🙂).
  
    And idk how much experience you’re coming in with but I had no perpective on the workload or difficulty of courses and in retrospect some of my planned out semester looked ridiculous in retrospect haha. There’s a lot of stuff you’ll only figure out from starting to take classes or talking to other students.
  
    It is kinda fun to plan all this stuff out but I wouldn’t take it too seriously. A year or two after you graduate your major won’t matter at all anymore. It’s good to keep all these things in the back of your head but you should really focus your time on learning and figuring out what you like more-so than majors/minors🙂.
  
    If you’re in CIT you have to take 2 intro classes so take mech e and ece. You should try out a few intro cs courses your freshman year too (concepts, 112, 122) and you’ll be on track for anything by the end of freshman year. Good luck!

    Hello! I’m a rising high school senior and before I start application season, I wanted to get direct honest opinions about the school from students who aren't trying to hype it up for a tour.A few things I am especially curious about:
  


    For CS and Software Engineering majors specifically, what's the workload like? Do you still have time for clubs and a social life or is it non stop work? Also, are the classes more about managing projects or do you get a lot of hands on experience with actual development?
  


    Carnegie Mellon’s theater program is pretty renowned, but I’m wondering how easy it is to get involved in theater if you’re not a performing arts major. Can someone who just wants to do musicals as a hobby get involved in clubs and productions?
  


    What have you found to be most unique about CMU that sets it apart from other schools?
  


    Running off that, what schools were you considering before selecting CMU and what was the deciding factor?
  


    And of course, what are the best and worst parts of student life?
  


    I’d love to hear literally anything else you feel is worth sharing, any info is much appreciated!

    It is probably made easier with help from your advisor, but the form in question is called the “Tuition Adjustment Appeal” and is sent to the office of enrollment management. There you put how much of the tuition you are applying to get refunded with the reason why, and I have experienced & heard that they are generally incredibly helpful.
  
    Also, you should be able to get it completely refunded, but for others with similar cases there is a policy where even after the deadline, tuition can be refunded proportional to how long into the course you were.
  
    Emailing your advisor but more importantly the mentioned office/liaison may have the ability to prevent it before then, but if you’ve received a bill for it, just submit the form and it will be resolved. Having been in a similar situation, I understand the first instinct is to email and demand aggressively against your advisor, which will not be particularly helpful. Just know there are structures in place to help, and it will be fixed.

    200k per year is a lot.  just because he chooses to take deductions and put into retirement, that doesn't mean he cannot change that decision to put more towards your education.  Not trying to be rude but that's not going to be an argument that will get very far.  cash flow is only a part of it - assets are a piece of it too.
  
    It does sound like from your situation that you should be getting more but hard to say because we don't know what you provided.  It is also a function of how much in assets your family has.  You didn't have that in your post but would guess that your family did some good things right but unfortunately, that means that it makes it more difficult to get financial aid.
  
    as someone else pointed out, there is always loans and other scholarships.

    How would you define minimal experience? I’m taking 10301(which is the same course as 601) right now, and I’d say that none of the assignments require a lot of complex programming, but there certainly is a significant amount of programming involved. The programming is all done in python, mostly just using NumPy(and later a bit of PyTorch), so if you have some familiarity with them, it’ll be useful. Realistically, good debugging skills and coding practices are important to the class, since you are implementing most of the models in each homework from near-scratch(frameworking starter code is given)
  
    If you have the relevant strengths in probability, vector calculus and linear algebra, I think you can get by with lesser programming skills. The course is primarily a math-heavy course, so having those math skills makes the programming portions a lot easier. You likely won’t need many Leetcode-style data structures and algorithm skills to succeed in this class.
  
    As an anecdote, my professor for that class says that he’s a mathematician and not really a computer scientist, so that might give you some perspective on the class. The TA teams are usually really helpful for debugging.
  
    Finally, homework 1 for 10301/601 is designed to measure student’s readiness for the course. If you take the class and the first homework is too hard CS/progrmaming-wise, then you’ll still have time to drop it and join another class

    True, but I’m 70% shure my case will be considerate by WES, not just my case, if they fix that problem I’ll be helping all students who transfer from my country not just me, cause it’s a system problem 🙏 I’m from El Salvador , the University of El Salvador. Almost nobady transfers to US. Google Academic grading in Vietnam, our country has the same. But cause many people transfer from Vietnam they have made an accurate research https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_Vietnam#:~:text=It%20is%20based%20on%20a,%2C%207.5%20becomes%203.0%2C%20etc.
  
    But my country is just no popular that people transfer. Nobady does, its super rare, I’m the only one trying to fix this problem and caring about this. My country is not marketable by WES, I think its like waste of money from them on researching a country where few or none people transfer. But I did pay for the process, it should be done well. I’m just want to have fair equivalence. if I do, I’ll be happy that I might help future generations who wants to move to US 🙏
  
    Yes I want to do that CC again, just scare of wasting time :/ and that I’ll be not accepted.
  
    I’m planing making an article about this and published it on my University before applying to look a solution.
  
    WES should contact my University and request details on how they are grading students.
  
    Yea my comparison was not good at all, I mean I went to best National University, hard to get there. It’s like Texas State University, Washington State University or any other Public University.

    On maps Mcgill is pretty far from Tepper. Is the method to bike it? e-scooter
  


    not that deep; its like max 10 min walk, just save the money and get some cardio in. gets a bit annoying in the winter, but its whatever. everyone also kinda laughs at the people with escooters, tbh.
  
    2. Courses. how does this look for the fall and i haven't done my spring ones yet. I was also thinking about taking 70-207 (on that, 70-207 or 36-200?) because it looks interesting.
  
    looks fine. dont take the tepper (70-) stat or math classes, i heard theyre just annoying cuz they try to add a ""business"" as pect to it but its just more unnecssary work that doesnt teach you anything.
  
    3. what can I skip with my qualifying aps? Stats, CSP, Calc AB, Human Geo, Music Theory. specifically the first 3. do some clubs look at aps?
  
    nobdoy gives a flying fuck about aps sat or hs gpa. aps are truly just to give you credit; on stellic and wiht advisors, theyll tell you which aps give you credit for what requirements, and youll figure that out. no need to worry abt this rn. (but to answer your question, stats lets you skip 36200, 4 or 5 in CSA lets you skip 15110 or 112 (although not recommended if you dk how to code), 5 in ab/bc lets you skip calc1 and 2. theres a ap credits chart online for cmu specifically search it up)
  
    4. I've heard cmu recently made 99-101 so that you can't take it over the summer. will this affect my workload much?
  
    bro what?? c@cm has been a thing for like ever; make sure to do it over the summer cuz its just some simple modules and a common sense final exam. during the school year you have mandatory attendence classes once a week and pretty tough final exam so its just annoying.
  
    4. double major. Business Admin and statML double major seems very appealing to me but I don't know at all how it will change my path, workload, opportunities, etc. any advice? should i commit to a double major as early as possible? should i take 21-127 because its a prereq to a lot of courses that I may end up liking?
  
    just keep your courses as is. when you come youll meet upperclassmen and can ask them a bunch of stuff, so dw about this rn. either way, for basically any major first year is just prereqs and you strat your core classes in siphomore year so you have a whole year to figure things out. ik peoople who declare as late as junior spring so no rush
  
    5. i definitely sound overambitious but dual degree vs double major? on that, if I wanted to do a DM/DD would I have to submit another app for it? or maybe only for some like cs bc cmu is goated
  
    uh cs double is not easy lol dont talk it down; every business freshmen comes in wanting to do it and cant even handle the ""skippable ap csa"" class (15112) and just end up sounding stupid. again, dont worry about doubles or additionals or anything youll figure it later
  
    6. genuinely, truly, actually, what is the workload like. like yes our heart is in the work but im talking on a day to day basis if I was just doing a bsba.
  
    stfu you sound cringe talking about heart is in the work and all that. its just a clowned apon thing. workload? its tiring if you try/care. most people here are like 9am classes grind til 1am, with classes, internship/club applications, club work, projects, hanging out with friends, homework, etc. if you want to be succesful, be prepared to work ur ass off. cmu hhas good resources but only for those who care to take advantage. this doesnt mean you have to be antisocial and depressed tho; ik people who mained 4.0s as cs majors and went to bars and frats every thursday-saturday night. just a matter of what you can handle and enjoy.
  
    7. any underground tips you only learnt when you began to live at cmu for a while that would have helped had you known them earlier?
  
    youll learn them when youre here :)
  
    8. What does being a student at CMU get you in the city of pittsburgh? discounts, hacks, etc.
  
    student senate actually has some cool stuff. free musuem access, free pittsburgh train access (gets you basically anywehre in pittsburhg with 10 mins of walking to and from stops), free news station accounts (nyt games!, wsj, forbes, etc.), and then some like occasional student discounts for city team games, popups, and etc. youll see the ones that matter to you pop up on newsletters flyers around campus or emails
  
    9. literally anything else
  
    chill tf out. dont be weird and bugging people so much on linkedin or instagram; youll be judged when people meet you on campus for the first time. just chill, do basic research, but be ready to network hella and ask upperclassmen for lots of advice. youll be fine. 90% of the stuff i tried to gather about cmu before coming was like either wrong or turned out to be useless lol.

    Hello everyone, I am currently a rising senior from the Bay Area and creating my college list. For context, I come from a competitive high school, and I think I'm one of the few people in the school who enjoys finals and APs. I get a sort of ""high"" and excitement from very intense periods of stress, but I don't enjoy prolonged stress. I probably don't care much about GPA for university since it matters less in job applications. I enjoy a somewhat competitive atmosphere and highly value my social life.
  
    I am intending to major in Computer Engineering or Electrical Engineering. I am curious about the overall campus atmosphere, culture, etc., as well as any pieces of advice or concerns you may have for me.
  
    To be specific:
  


    What made you choose this university?
  


    What would two pieces of advice you'd give to an incoming freshmen?
  


    Is the CE or EE department good? Are job/intern opportunities available?
  


    How competitive is the atmosphere, and is it collaborative? (I want a balance of both.)
  


    Are engineering students overly stressed out? If so, how do people avoid burnout/stress?
  


    Is the social scene cliquey or more open? (I hate cliques.)
  


    Anything else?

    People are really passionate. Some professor once said that the thing you will miss most about CMU is how easy it is to surround yourself with people with similar academic interests as you and do solid work. If you plan classes correctly, you can get a very good overview of different fields within CS so you get a better idea of what you like. Compared to say Berkeley, getting into research is really easy, just ask any professor you have a class with. If they don’t have a project, they will recommend you to someone who does. Campus is pretty medium sized in a medium sized city, so best of both worlds. It’s also pretty small in the sense you will be like 3 degrees separated from anyone you would ever want to network with and people are friendly. I definitely haven’t taken advantage of most of the things CMU offers but I still had a blast.

    Your academic advisor, student center for academic success (I might have botched the ordering of that one), and even peer mentors can give you more specific and detailed advice.
  
    But generally, it’s important to ask yourself how you got to where you are. In my experience as a student and an RA, especially in CIT, it’s a big transition to life at CMU. Though the idea of a social life exists within CIT and larger CMU it’s not exactly a priority for many students and you WILL have to take hits in the grade department to make time.
  
    I was in a very similar place my freshman year. The best advice I got was something like this:
  
    You’ve spent your whole life trying to get into a school like this. You already made it. You’re with some of the smartest people in your age group, most of them were at the top of their class. It’s not going to be easy and there is no shame saying “I tried, I was there, and I did my best.” But what you ultimately need to ask yourself is if it aligns with your goals. What will CMU provide you that somewhere else can’t? Is there a specific reason you came here beyond just the prestige?
  
    If you were smart enough to get into CMU CIT you’ll be fine at almost any other engineering school you’d transfer to. From what I hear they are a lot less intense, and generally have similar outcomes. CMU grads have a higher starting salary on average (based on the CPDC stats) but how much is that worth to you?
  
    It will be a lot of effort to get back on track k but it is possible if you want it. The phrase I’ve heard over and over in ECE is that after four years of hell, everything else is easy. So far that seems to hold true.
  
    Best of luck!
  
    TL;DR: Why did you choose CMU in the first place? Why not somewhere else beyond the prestige? Talk to your advisors; they are there to help. It’s a tough time but can be worth it if you want it to be/goals align with CMUs outcomes mission.
