cmu,campus map,,"

    Just got around to reading your response!
  
    Luckily, I was assigned a single, so I hope to keep my room bug free lol
  
    I’m relieved about the bathrooms. My parents had a rule that we had to clean the shower/bathroom every time we used it!
  
    Lmao my brother does the same with his laundry so I suppose I’ll be used to it.
  
    Looking at the campus map, it seems Donner is the closest dorm to the center of campus so that’s awesome :)
  
    Thanks for the response!

    CMU is a pretty liberal campus that is generally accepting, or at least tolerating. It’s not a center of LGBTQ+ social life and activism, but it has some resources and community. The health insurance covers most trans care, and the university’s health services also has great resources. There’s a pretty active undergrad LGBTQ+ club that also hosts a weekly affinity group for transgender and non-binary students. The Center for Diversity and Inclusion has recently begun to make efforts to include Trans-related programming.
  
    Of course, it’s not perfect. I’ve heard two major complaints. Navigating the bureaucracy around transitioning can be difficult if you begin the process while enrolled at cmu (mostly the name-change process). And I’ve heard that a significant number of the all-gender restrooms listed on campus maps are actually in restricted access areas, and the accessible ones are too sparsely distributed to be convenient (please feel free to correct me if that has changed, though). However, I suspect that you will be pleasantly surprised by CMU after living in the south.

    I think you’re right about a lot of this, but I disagree that the students aren’t smart. Most of us are both intelligent and hardworking, and we’re smart enough to have learned to use shortcuts.
  
    Maybe my expectations were skewed coming into this environment (I’m in a Masters program, undergrad is a little different), but I expected deep thinking and very advanced problem solving to be a huge part of the curriculum. I expected to be generating original thought. Instead, you’re right—it’s workhorse training. How much volume can you produce with an impossible deadline? I think that’s a disservice to students who are really quite brilliant and typically already have the work ethic and self discipline.

    CMU admissions are a black box - we don't get to see our admissions files afterwards, or get told ""what"" got us in. a) CMU doesn't tell us and b) admissions are holistic, so I doubt there's any one thing. That being said, you're likely to hear some very high GPAs and standardizing scores because that is the average amongst most admitted students. If you're looking for that information I'd suggest looking up the CDS for CMU. And everyone will have different extracurriculars, some of those in common including olympiads and internships/work experience.
  
    Trying to compare yourself to already admitted students is not the best way of going about this. The important part is focusing on bringing your grades up to the best they can be and partaking in extracurriculars you're actually passionate about. Start your essays early and don't shortcut any part of your app. Hard work and time management will serve you better than any kind of comparison will. Fwiw, my SAT was 1580 and my GPA a 4.0. ECs included research, sport, internships, and music. But I don't think any of this info helps you at all.

    With your intros and math classes you’ll probably spend most of your time between Doherty and Porter Hall . None of the dorms are really that close but I guess going from Morewood there’s shortcuts through the buildings . West Wing is pretty central . if you had a class first thing in the morning in Posner then Donner or Hamerschlag is closest
  
    Generally most of the offices and some classes sit in these areas:
  
    Mech E in Scaife
  
    ECE in Hamerschlag
  
    BME in Scott
  
    EPP in Wean
  
    CEE in Porter
  
    Chem E in Doherty

    I recommend living on the Residence on Fifth (lived in there this year). People hesitate to choose it because it's far, but I think it's really not. There's a shortcut your Orientations Leaders will show you that will take you to campus in 10-15 minutes walking. If you have a bike or skateboard, you could get there faster. You can get to Tepper in 10.
  
    You trade distance for amenities. You get a kitchen and bathroom. The triples are really neat because you have a bedroom, but also a ""living room"" area where the desks, couches and table are. There's a small theatre on the mezzanine floor. Small (very) gym on lobby floor. Closer to all the off-campus food places. Korean super market across the street. Generally, it's more quiet.
  
    As for roommate assignment, you get access to a portal. You can meet people on there through the questionnaire you take about your habits and it matches you. Most people post on the FaceBook and make friend/meet roommates there (highly recommend that. a lot better). Then when you decide, you request them on the portal. You put your preferences housing in order by residence and what room you want (double, triple, etc). Then on assignment day, everyone is assigned a number and they pick at random and assign a room to you and your roommate. So a group of 4 have a higher chance of being picked than 2.

    The ravine was already there, they filled it in. It’s called the cut because it used to be a shortcut for people who go down the ravine and up the other side instead of walking around it. Part of the ravine is still present behind/under Gates and at the bottom of Wean.

    - To me, Doherty is the place where ChemE's go for exile. Jk, but I've been to the labs in the basement, and it is one of the sketchiest and obscure places I've been on-campus so far. In general, I think it's just a very old building
  
    - I go there almost everyday, but primarily for classes. It's also a very useful shortcut to Wean despite the weird floor-matchups (5th floor Wean connects to A-floor Doherty, and 7th floor Wean connects to 2nd floor Doherty). It's not the best place for study/socializing, in my opinion, considering the limited number of seats and tables available
  
    - There is a weird, narrow corridor in Doherty with orange-lighting. I don't remember how I got there or where it connects
  
    - Favorite spot in Doherty Hall is the table on the 2nd floor located near the entrance to Wean 7th floor and the elevator

    I know you said you liked Mudge but I lived in Rez on Fifth and loved it! You get your own personal bathroom, living room (more space!), and kitchenette. Also a full fridge to store all the food you get from the wonderful city of pittsburgh, which is only 10-15 min away walking and probably 3 min by bus. Campus is not far either, also 10-15 min away if you know all the shortcuts ;) had lots of fun cooking with my roommates and neighbors at 1am. freshman year was a blast.
  
    edit: I also wanted to add the other commenters are right about the lottery system, getting roommates will increase the chance of you getting the room you want
  
"

    Yeah I agree, I think it would be helpful if there was just a nice pdf map that said which floors of buildings connect to each other (4th floor Wean to 2nd floor Newell-Simon to 4th floor Gates-Hillman for example), which floor of buildings doors are on (Wean front door on floor 5, back door on floor 1, etc), and maybe some general sense of the topography outside. Maybe such a thing exists, idk! But I've never found it if so.
  
    Until then, we rely on trial and error or building-specific searches to realize that you can get from Margeret Morrison to Wean 6th floor quickest by entering Doherty, but only if you go up a floor and back down or down a floor and back up. Like someone else said, I guess you realize this after a few weeks, and then can enjoy your slight shortcuts.

    I was in E-tower this year and it was really nice. It had a great community and you can make a lot of friends just by stopping by in the breezeway and saying hi to people. E tower also has little activities like Fridays at 5 where the ambassadors cook/make snacks for us, and then there’s little parties here and there for Christmas break or Valentine’s Day.
  
    I don’t know why but there were issues with alarms going off but hopefully that’ll be fixed next semester.
  
    Also Morewood is really good in general because it’s close to most of the buildings and you can find shortcuts to other buildings

    So the admin shouldn't be held accountable for failing to get donations for the things they promise in the master plan? It's on the first page of the master plan.  I get that it would be a big price tag but things included in the campus master plan should be realistic.   I suspected from the first time I saw it in the plan that the admin is way too cheap to pay for it.  A large portion of the multibillion dollar endowment is not directed/restricted anyway.
  
    It's a matter of pedestrian safety on Forbes.   They have pushed a lot of undergrads to live in the craig st corridor but it's too crowded on the forbes rd panther hollow bridge and everybody cutting through NS and Wean. Its going to actually make the situation worse because it will have classrooms that are isolated from the rest of campus and force people to go back and forth over the forbes bridge.  The new bridge would have benefited undergrads with classes in porter/baker/schlag/scaife.  But maybe the admin doesn't care about that.
  
    Maybe its still part of the plan but I'm skeptical that there is no mention of plans for a future bridge being incorporated into the new building...

    Restaurants:

    Kavsar - pickup-only Uzbek restaurant. If you haven’t had Uzbek food before I recommend you try it https://maps.app.goo.gl/pcd1atPmSZ7aoT2S7?g_st=ic

    Everyday Noodles is one of my favorite spots. Straightforward Chinese noodle bowls, I like the dan dan noodles a lot, generally prefer their dry bowls to soup bowls, but everything is good. You can see them making the noodles which is fun https://maps.app.goo.gl/sgKnXoFLpUJPgspQA?g_st=ic

    New Dumpling House - basically just a standard Americanized Chinese restaurant, but their dumplings are like really really good, at least I thought so during undergrad https://maps.app.goo.gl/H3UW8P4axKgYHHk99?g_st=ic

    Noodlehead - fantastic Thai food. Not much else to say here. Cash only. The ice cream place next door is called Millie’s and it’s also really good, I think they’ve opened up a few more spots since I left https://maps.app.goo.gl/DHYxsXVGZyGqDMye7?g_st=ic

    Tram’s Kitchen - cash only Vietnamese place, only went once or twice but it was an insane deal for the quality https://maps.app.goo.gl/BrJkruMQPNMPKEAp9?g_st=ic

    Salem’s - halal cafeteria-style restaurant with a butcher/market attached next door even crazier deals than Tram’s Kitchen https://maps.app.goo.gl/xZabHpeemYU8Guvu5?g_st=ic

    La Feria - Peruvian breakfast place. It’s upstairs from Pamela’s which is kind of a Pittsburgh breakfast staple but imo La Feria is better (still check out Pamela’s though) https://maps.app.goo.gl/yN6ytbGVwxgRBxLv7?g_st=ic

    Kiin Lao & Thai Eatery - exactly what it sounds like, if you’ve never had Lao food you should definitely try it here cause it’s great https://maps.app.goo.gl/5LBgarm5LtwovQGV6?g_st=ic

Maybe my favorite bar in the world, but if you’re sensitive to smoke/smells be careful https://lemardigras.com/about-le-mardi-gras/

    Kelly’s is also a solid dive bar outside South Side, surprisingly good food https://maps.app.goo.gl/3AqgtrfUdzSwxTwD6?g_st=com.google.maps.preview.copy

    If you’re a beer person, I’d recommend both Church Brew Works (located in an old church) and East End Brewery
  
    Things that aren’t food:
  
    Rowhouse Cinema is a one-screen independent theater. There’s a beer store attached so you can grab something from there and bring it in
  
    Just google the list of museums in the city, they’re all good
  
    Randyland is an outdoor art project thing run by a local folk artist for a few decades now I believe. It’s in the middle of the Mexican War Streets which have some very pretty old row houses, plus the Mattress Factory

    Unless proficiency in English is relevant to your major, it should not have an impact on his contributions. Bridging language gaps is a key skill that will help you a lot more in the later parts of your life. I had a similar case during my Masters program with a student who first learned English at the age of 14. While it was challenging at times to decipher what he meant, a lot of what he had to say had a tremendous amount of impact on our contributions.
  


    These tests are outrageous. 99% of the vocabulary requested in these tests are not in use in either your classes or in regular conversations. While I did not cheat on them, I would completely understand the impulse to do so because it was a lot of rote memorization that was ultimately obsolete.

    I also had to choose between CMU and Cornell! I had another opinion of Cornell going in lol, mainly because I’m from NY and my school feeds into Cornell. I’ve heard all the stories of depression from there, especially from the engineering school. They had to put a net under what the students called the “suicide bridge” so do what you will with that. The surrounding area is basically only a college town, so you can’t really go out anywhere else besides school. They also sent me a likely letter, but I couldn’t shake all the stories of being depressed from my friends and classmates who went there. Keep in mind I am very biased due to the people I know so take what I say with a grain of salt.
  
    In terms of CS CMU and Cornell aren’t even close. The huge amount of opportunities with jobs and internships are almost just handed to you, especially as you go closer towards graduation. The breadth in CS and the support is amazing too. There is only one CS major in Cornell Engineering, while at CMU SCS, you can choose between CS, AI, comp bio, and human-computer interaction. Besides the primary majors, there’s additional majors/concentrations in Robotics, systems, language technologies (like NLP), computer graphics, ML, security, and software engineering. In Ideate there are minors in game design & animation and much more. You’ll learn all about these majors in the freshman immigration course if you choose to go here.
  
    Besides having so much to explore in SCS itself, CMU is also interdisciplinary, and you’re able to take essentially any class you want. I took a Body Politics class once and talked about the clitoris all day. It was awesome.
  
    Addressing the depression at CMU, it’s not going to be much worse at what is happening at Cornell. I don’t really experience this, but I think for those that are depressed, they’re mainly depressed at work in the classes, not competition. You bond with the people you’re taking these classes with, and you help each other succeed.
  
    I ultimately chose CMU due to these reasons and I don’t regret my choice one bit. I almost went to Cornell too because I hadn’t heard of CMU before applying to college but now that I’ve spent 4 years here, I can safely say you would be throwing away a huge professional/educational opportunity if you chose Cornell. Congrats though on getting in all 3 schools, that’s a huge accomplishment!! :)

    Is it through NSH and Wean
  

    Yes, I think it’s this one.
  
    I’d guess the best way is going around the East side of Hamburg Hall (unless you are on the far West side of Tepper and go out the Tepper 1 door, then go on the West side), then entering NSH, going up a floor in the stairs in its lobby, crossing the bridge to Wean 4, going up a flight to Wean 5, then crossing that quad to Porter.
  
    Going down to Wean 1 takes too long because slow elevator and stairs adds time too, and avoiding Wean entirely (such as going past the fence) is too circuitous.

    Hey I'm a five year alumnus from the CEE undergrad program. I loved remediation and groundwater management so that was my focus. The department is pretty small, even as CMU is fairly small this is definitely one of the smaller departments. It means you get really close, which is great since most of your work will be in teams for labs and reports and such. They have dedicated undergraduate teaching professors who are there for you and take you through your tenure there up to your capstone class. You're really there to learn how to solve problems, work in teams, and write reports for different groups of people. You'll learn either how to do things technically or how to manage time/people/resources, and you'll do it while being expected to excel at one of the hardest schools in the country. If you like infrastructure development, cleaning our environment, becoming a bridge between communities and experts, being of real use to the world, I would recommend this program.
  
    You'll also be setting yourself on track to get a PE as this is an accredited program. They have their own career fair since CMU's general fairs don't always draw the companies we'll end up at, so they made their own. I worked for a contracting company (from that job fair) for a while, got a Master's, then wound up at an environmental consulting firm.
  
    I'll add they only created the environmental degree program this past year or so, and while I'm very jealous new students get to have that, I'm also very happy new students get to have that. I can't speak for the current state of the department but I think it was a great place for me. Hopefully will be for you, too!

    BCSA/Design '21 alum here. Here are my notes on Doherty
  


    I had a couple classes in Doherty during my time at CMU and OH MY GOD it was impossible to find your room on the first day of classes. The building is laid out so illogically (which makes it kind of charming, but still a pain in the ass).
  


    Most of the upper levels are split and completely unconnected in the middle, save for that one level (floor 2 or 3, I don't remember) they just stuck a covered bridge in. It's honestly one of the funniest architectural features on campus to me.
  


    A pretty decent section of the basement levels of the building belong to the School of Art and it's this amazing case study on how artists occupy space in the same building differently from other academics. You can tell once you're in one of the art sections of the building. (Also, Art's digital print studio is in Doherty and it's totally worth trying to finagle your way into if you want access to some tools Design doesn't have).
  


    If you go to the backside of the building (the side that faces Gates), there's a staircase that runs the entire height of the building and has windows on three sides the whole way up.
  


    At the bottom level, under the stairs, is a tiny closet, literally a hole in the wall, that the art students sometimes reserve to do installation pieces in. It's an absolutely bizarro thing to discover in the middle of the night when you're lost in Doherty.
  


    At the top of that staircase is a door to access the roof closed with a padlock. If you're lucky it might be unlocked (though it probably won't be so don't get your hopes up).
  




    The floors in Wean and Doherty are fairly misaligned. This becomes apparent in the elevator between the two and in that liminal space where the two buildings blend into each other.
  


    There is a teeny-tiny museum of scientific instruments on level 1 (I think). I don't think anybody pays attention to it but it's a fun detail.
  


    This is going to be somewhat useless because I don't totally remember where it is, but near one of the elevators on the art levels of Doherty is a fairly useful map of what's going on in each floor of the building. I don't remember whether it's the whole building or just the lower levels, but regardless, it's helpful if you're trying to figure out the maze that is the building.
  


    Like all the Hornbostel buildings [ie the original ones] on campus, if you look up at where the roof meets the exterior walls, there's ceramic detailing that's unique to the building. Once you start paying attention to it, it's a gorgeous little detail of the original campus.
  


    I think I did the same project you're doing now when I was at CMU. Honestly I had a lot of fun just trying to figure out the madness of that building

    it can depend on the company. i know one where someone reneged at a consulting company and the hiring manager was just like shucks and moved on. I know investment firms taking reneging more seriously and spread word around to other companies, so I'd imagine more older, conservative companies may have a higher risk of reneging. I've also heard of someone reneging at a bank (not major one but not small either) and it turned out fine, but their explanation was 'for personal reasons'. The bridge is likely temporarily burned, no one is going to keep track of you for too long, you could probably reapply in about 5 years or so or sooner depending on how much the company cares

    Pirates games are still fairly cheap, especially for standing room tickets; you can sit off the left field wall in the restaurant, which is a great view of the field.  Riverhounds are the city soccer club, and their tickets are nearly free.  Hockey and football are $$$$.
  

    Mostly though, if you're a first year here, the best thing is to meet more people until you find the ones that click.

    Honestly? When I saw this post I thought I would have a bunch of things, but....after some thought, I don't really. It's all minor stuff:
  


    Pushed buggy once.
  


    Visited the steam tunnels.
  


    Stayed in better contact with professors I really liked (like stopping by their office hours in later semesters).
  


    Gone to Academic Development for weekly 1:1 sessions sooner.

    Well, it wasn't a slogan but for years there was this outline of hair and mustache of a student that rowdy architecture kids painted everywhere they could on campus to mock him. It was painted on walls, in elevators, flyers and more. According to what intel I could gather, they may have even tried to make a table and chairs out of it and landed themselves on the Architecture School black list for it. I wouldn't be surprised if some of that graffiti still exists in some dark corner of the underground tunnels or that secret student storage room of theirs over in [redacted].
  
    There was also a vintage ""Kilroy was here"" behind a studio water fountain.
  
    And when the CFA shelves built by DFAB were torn down, there was found a slogan having being written on many of the wood parts that ""J.W. is a tool.""  Also written in the Maggie Mo archie bathroom.

    Welcome! I may be underestimating a 5 min walk but it's definitely less than 10. Depending on what time you get there, you shouldn't have to park terribly far passed the pool itself. Also, you can cut the corner by walking on the street via the underpass on panther hollow road rather than following the pedestrian walkway that loops you around to a different tunnel. I've been walking it for years.

    Are the tunnels still accessible?

steam tunnel

"

    I don't know if it's still possible; it's been many years since I was on campus to do this.  You used to be able to go into the front doors of Hamburg, out the back, into the Robotics building, down to the basement, through a tunnel that led to an exit across from the 1st floor of Science Hall Wean, in there and up to the 5th floor, then outside to HH.
  
    I'm probably forgetting a step. It's been a long while.

    B in 112 is fine. Best tip for transferring is to take the same courses that IS majors of your year are taking so that you are on track to graduate. Most current IS sophomores have taken:
  


    67-250 IS Milieux - Freshman fall
  


    You will be one of the late-transfer juniors who take this class their junior spring. These students typically take 262 jr fall, then 250 & 272 concurrently in jr spring.
  




    67-262 Database design and dev - Soph fall (FALL ONLY)
  


    must already be in IS to take this class
  




    67-272 App design and dev - soph spring now (SPRING ONLY)
  


    must already be in IS to take this class. 262 is a pre-req, so it's impossible to be a potential transfer taking this anyway.
  




    15-122 or 15-121 - freshman spring or sophomore fall
  


    take this asap, over the summer if you can. It's a hard class though
  




    Apply this semester, don't miss the deadline. You need your advisor to approve/write something so don't procrastinate. Learn the flexible paths that the cmu IS program has to offer. They want to know that you've done your research and can take full advantage of the program given your archie background, rather than being tunnel-visioned into swe. What have you learned from your 2 years of architecture about your likes/dislikes that made you gravitate towards IS? Explore, but know what you want. IS is flexible, but you need to take advantage of that to have a goal and a certain path you want to take, especially with only 2 years left.
  
    Do a UX internship or summer research (suggestion: HCI department) this summer -- more doable than SWE  given your design background. It should help you decide between UX or SWE because prepping for those 2 careers is different, especially as a rising junior.
  
    If you don't get in, another option is doing the 4-year Arch BA program and taking some HCI  classes. You can apply your design training for UX -- something that non-CFA students may lack.
  
    Good luck.

    I feel you man. I hated much of my time at CMU. the culture was terrible enough for me to outweigh the great resources available, and I experienced what you’re talking about with people acting smart for its own sake. I hated it so much I studied abroad my last semester then graduated early. Thankfully the degree does actually come in handy a ton, much more than I expected... so it was for sure worth it in the end. Just wanted to let you know there is a bright light at the end of the tunnel, since I was in a similar headspace when I was there.
  
"
cmu,tunnel,,"

    Every math class I've ever had has been in Doherty, so 4 semesters now and I still regularly find myself lost in that building. The stairs from floor to floor have an absolutely nonsensical design, very chaotic.
  
    Did a midnight run in the tunnels under the Hall once and ended up in an abandoned chemistry classroom which was dope.
  
    Best building to find classrooms to study in at night.
  
    Also if you can manage to figure out the stairwell navigation, it can be incredibly efficient to navigate to Wean from DH

    Been there, done that. You will survive! Keep your head up and look at the light at the end of the tunnel. Sending you much love and strength :)

    Unless they've closed it off, there used to be a trap door in the Doherty basement (maybe level 1 or 2 basement?) in front of the art studios, near the entrance to Wean. They used to put trash cans on top of it to hide it. That went into the steam tunnels under Doherty that extended across The Mall.
  
    Hamerschlag Hall also has a steam tunnel entrance with a trap door behind the building on the ridge toward the railroad tracks. I don't remember exactly where it is anymore though (graduated 2013)
  
"
cmu,tunnel,,"

    You used to be able to get to the roof of Hammerschlag Hall via the main elevator, but you still needed a key. I think many of the grad students with offices in HH had the key.
  
    If I remember correctly, going into the steam tunnels will get you kicked out of school.
  
"
cmu,between buildings,,"

    Yep! I didn't know I was going to do a CS major, until I really liked a class I took. I talked to my advisor about it, and just added the curriculum for a double major to my plan online. I was then able to see all the classes I needed to take.
  
    I had a friend who used to live on Rez on Fifth. He said he really didn't like it because it's pretty far away, but he also said he didn't know anybody and didn't like his roommates. It's not really that far away, probably like an average 12 minute walk? If you want to take full advantage of a kitchen though, it might be your best bet.
  
    As for the scooter, it's totally up to you. A lot of people use bikes to get to campus or the hover boards or whatever they're called. You wouldn't be out of place but why? It's such a small campus, usually it'll just be small walks between buildings. With a scooter, you'd have to find, then lock it to the nearest rack, pick it up afterwards, tote it with you if you're walking with a friend, etc.. It's up to you but it seems more like an inconvenience to me if you just want to use to get around campus.
  
"
cmu,how to get to,,"

    On campus? Explore! See if you can find the F level of Hamerschlag, how to get to the roof of CFA, etc...
  
    Off campus probably has more interesting things. There's holiday celebrations happening in downtown, at the various museums (Phipps is always a popular one to visit given its proximity to CMU) and Kennywood. Facebook can be a good way to find out about various events, or just checking local news stations like WPXI.

    If this is a post just to vent, I get it and I feel for you because we all feel like we’ve chosen wrong sometimes. If you’re expecting some agreement or advice on how to get to cmu, I don’t think you’ll get that. let me ask you: how can you say you would be happier at cmu than cornell? you really can’t be certain of that. making peace with our decisions, regardless of whether they’re “right” or “wrong” is part of the human experience so rather than longing for a life you’ll never have, focus on the amazing people, experiences, and opportunities in your life right now. wishing you the best.

    I lived in Polish Hill for a year and Squirrel Hill for a year. I bought a used bike and biked daily to campus, all-weather (including rain and snow, you can clean off and change on campus). I think it is worth getting a bike if you're living off campus and don't plan on getting a car; it opens up the range of places that you can go to significantly (e.g., have biked to Costco, Pittsburgh Paintball Park, though those are outliers).
  
    Some thoughts:
  


    BikePGH has a bike map [0] that shows what roads are good to bike on. Figure out how to get to campus from your place.
  


    I personally don't think the bike sharing program is worth it, but ymmv. Never used it, just wasn't a fan of the pricing.
  


    Find safe spots to park your bike. Campus is generally safe. Once I forgot my bike lock and just left it unlocked on the bike rack on Gates 5 where there are cameras watching, nothing happened.
  


    Buses can be a little unreliable (especially if you're not on the 61 line, it can add up to 1h travel time), which is why I prefer biking. But most buses have bike parking in front of the bus, so if you're sick or the weather is bad or your lights are out etc, you can just take the bus.
  


    On that note, you only need a good bike light to be road legal here. Helmet strongly encouraged though.
  


    Pittsburgh drivers can be a little aggressive and/or dumb. A housemate got spooked in traffic by a car coming up to them and yelling, and I've come pretty close to being clipped by passing buses before. If there's nobody around (e.g., now, COVID times), consider biking slowly on the sidewalk instead until you're confident about biking on the road. Also don't be afraid to claim the road when it is legal to do so. Usually bikers here will claim the road and let cars pass whenever it is safe.
  


    Because the above might sound too scary, when I started biking here again I hadn't biked for at least 10 years prior and couldn't bike reliably around the block. I biked back slowly from South Side mostly on empty sidewalks to CMU and made it back in one piece. It isn't so bad once you get used to it, just pay attention to the road.
  


    The only time I would say you should not bike is the first day after a snow, before they've managed to really salt the roads. Too much barely-visible ice and an extra level of wackiness to drivers. Bike with extreme caution on days like that.
  


    Feel free to ask more questions! I haven't biked (or moved at all much) since the pandemic started, happy to suggest routes or socially distanced bike-around with you for a bit in the Fall if you're also vaccinated by then.

    Wait YES. (Did an English group project on this)
  
    For the public bus system the best options are Google maps and Transit, both of which you can tell where you are and where you are going and it tells you how you can use public buses to get there, though Transit does so with the live data of bus locations (and is very helpful if you ever want to know when a bus is coming).
  
    For the CMU shuttle and escort there isn’t a similar app for how to get from here to here, though there is a Ride Systems app (with horrible UI) and a website andysbuses.com/routes which shows routes and live locations. And what the shuttle and escort service also has is a document made by a couple of students for an English project which explains how to use them and can be found here.
  
"

    shr4162's response is great for specifics and I don't have anything better to add, but I wanna add some things about the generic mindset to have here.
  
    The last thing CMU students are is unfriendly or cold or unwelcoming. They come in all shapes and sizes - some are outgoing, others are maybe reserved, and you need to do some work to get them to open up. That just requires you to be more social and outgoing to initiate an interaction.
  
    Plus those of us who've been here for a while have pre-existing groups and social networks that take up our time. If I were to come across you somewhere I'd be happy to invite you for, idk say a soccer game or whatever, but if I have some close friends that's really all I can handle as ""full time friends"".
  
    But that's not the case with your incoming cohort. They're all people like you - coming to a new city, country even, figuring out courses, internships, homeworks, jobs, how to get from NSH to Hammerschlag without stepping outside - things like that.
  
    That does not mean that you shouldn't form friendships outside your cohort - you should be reaching out and talking to everybody. All I'm saying is that statistically, your cohort is best suited as potential friend opportunities than other people.
  
    It gets much easier when you have a couple of friends... then you just meet more people through them and keep doing it ad infinitum and you'll start running into ""wow what a small world"" situations. You just need to stop being anxious, go out, and reach out to people. I knew this person who was here for 1.5 years (Masters), and seemed to know more people by the end of their program than me (and I've been here for 4 years).
  
"
cmu,wayfinding,,"

    From email this morning:
  

    Dear Members of the CMU Community:
  


    I am writing to advise you that an invitation-only campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris will take place on Carnegie Mellon’s campus today. Please note that access to certain buildings and walkways may be limited on Wednesday, and we ask that you be mindful of any wayfinding restrictions.
  


    Given this activity, it is important to review the rules and regulations governing campaign events on campus. All nonprofit institutions, such as CMU, must follow federal regulations in hosting or sponsoring campaign events. For instance, employee and student organizations can invite a candidate to speak on campus and the university may agree to host the event, but federal regulations require a comparable invitation to all other candidates for that office. Campaigns must cover the cost of using a CMU space and cannot hold fundraisers on campus. In each instance, the university works closely with a campaign to ensure adherence to safety, proper logistical coordination and minimal disruption to campus operations. For more details on expectations and requirements for political events on campus, review these FAQs.
  


    This event is a clear reminder that we are entering the final weeks before the Nov. 5 general election and political activity on and around our campus is growing. Thank you in advance for cooperation during this election season.
  


    Respectfully,
  


    Daryl Weinert Vice President for Operations Carnegie Mellon University
