behavioral health,/user/throwaway112505/,UNC Class of 2016,"Sounds like things have only gotten significantly worse since I was a student. Here's a little snapshot example of how stuff played out for me:I developed an eating disorder as a student, probably due to the stressful environment. For context, eating disorders affect like half of all college students and are the #1 most deadly mental illness.The campus dietician was super helpful. But she also said I really need to see a therapist but that CAPS resources for my situation were extremely overwhelmed, so I would need to find my own therapist somewhere else.I couldn't have a car on campus and was too busy with my daily class schedule + studying for the one exam and one quiz that I had EVERY single week of the semester. So, I didn't feel like I had the time or resources for therapy and didn't go. Recovery on my own was horrible.I did see CAPS the previous year for issues with adjusting to college life and it was extremely unhelpful. Everyone says to go to CAPS if you need help, so I was pretty discouraged and left feeling a little lost. I've seen several helpful therapists later in life and now realize just how bad my CAPS therapist was.Major issues:CAPS needs more funding and higher quality resources.Some classes are designed to be overly difficult to weed students out. I literally heard professors say (in a conversation amongst themselves) that that were trying to weed specific types of students out of their classes. When they solicited feedback mid-semester because the class was going SO poorly, they said that all the problems we brought up in our feedback were our fault and that they wouldn't be implementing any of our suggestions. All of this is just ridiculous.Majors need to be designed with job outcomes in mind. Things don't need to be overly difficult for no reason. Courses need to align with the current job market. Students need to feel like their education will actually help them achieve their goals after college.They need to dedicate a chunk of new student orientation, Week of Welcome, and dorm events to mental health. And I don't mean puppies and pizza. Real discussions of mental health problems that may be specific to college life and how to approach them with real strategies. For example, I learned a lot of skills in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (a decade late lol) that can be useful in a variety of situations.",49 upvotes
behavioral health,,,"Dear OP, please, please, please don't drop out of Comp SciUnfortunately, I know what you're talking about, and I've been where you are. The people you are talking about are toxic, and they only care about flexing, and you should ignore them.I surrounded myself with people you mentioned in the post for some time, and it was a terrible mistake. I made the false assumption that my self-worth depends on the kind of internship I got. I ended up falling into depression and barely passing a semester.Try not to pay attention to these kinds of people. Cutting off these people completely made my life so much better. The prestigious internship doesn't worth your mental health. If you're enjoying coding and comp sci, don't let these assholes stop you. If you're following CompSci and CSCareerQuestions subreddits, please unfollow them and refer to them only if you need specific information.Besides that, it's not too late to get an internship, and if you're uncomfortable with technical interviews, there are plenty of companies that do only behavioral questions. Even if you don't get an internship for your last summer, you most definitely will still be able to get a good job with a CS degree from UNC.OP, stay strong, and I'm wishing you all the bestFeel free to message me :)",27 upvotes
behavioral health,/user/el229/,UNC 2022,"They only offer one semester max of free therapy through CAPS and then they “connect you to an outside provider” aka you have to find an outside therapist covered by your insurance and pay for it. if you’re only looking to use CAPS for an initial evaluation/meeting then yes they are good for that.

behavioral health,/user/Lazy_Gazelle_7193/,UNC 2023,"I’m a senior graduating this upcoming semester. As a sophomore, I would have explored more classes, joined clubs w the intention of getting a senior position, and gone to office hours more. Go with your passion, not what you should study or do. A lack of passion is detectable. Believe in yourself, even when you don’t. In applications and all that stuff, write as if you believe it, and genuinely try to if you don’t. I would have tried to communicate w my professors more to meet my needs, instead of relying only on myself. I would have applied to internships, even if they seemed like a stretch. Make every moment intentional (not something I didn’t do, but I think this kept me from regretting things).No regrets though — did my best, considering my sophomore year was spent at home due to the pandemic. Give yourself grace for your own path and your needs — don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Oh, on that note, I wouldn’t have let loud, critical voices who seemed to know what’s best for me get in my head. The best thing I learned as a junior was to trust that I know what’s best for me, and that it’s okay to trust my desires (career wise).edit: I want to give some input based on things I did right, too. Try to understand yourself. What motivates you, when you feel happiest, why you react the way you do in certain situations, what behaviors make you feel your best. For me, it’s having enough time in the morning to slow down and make every action meaningful, from making my coffee to putting everything I need in my bag. It makes me feel more relaxed and reassured that I will have everything I need to get my work done. Working out has saved my mental health, and having a strict schedule helps me get my work done. Take it hour by hour, step by step, day by day. Figure out what makes you tick, whatever it may be. It’s the little things that make the big things.",3 upvotes
behavioral health,/user/Hands/,Alum,"Pretty early in the year for that!It's no big deal, if everything is the same as it was when I was in school a decade or so ago you'll just probably have to meet with your community director, they'll tell you they're disappointed in your behavior etc.  If you were referred to campus health you will have to take a like half hour long training course on a computer about the dangers of alcohol (I think it was called eCHUG lmao but this was like 2008).The first time it's just a slap on the wrist tho, you have nothing to worry about.

Sometimes it gets full though. You could also try SPHG 101 which is an introduction to public health fields. I have not taken it but could be interesting.  They made some new classes in health behavior - HBEH 520, 510, 531 that I don't think have any prereqs. Also maybe bios 512 data science basics?

behavioral health,/user/sailor_rini/,Alum,"Okay, now that I'm awake, I wanted to address this comment specifically (and I initially had this reaction to the title as well, until I read). I see your point, but quite frankly, this is part of the problem, and seems to deny the concept of virtue-signalling altogether which is what I believe OP is getting at.  I do see your point in that sometimes accusations of ""virtue signalling"" can be unfair, and often are virtue signals in and of themselves. And I've called someone out before for precisely that, as it came across as a belief that only ""they"" are the moral ones and everyone else is a ""virtue signaller"", which is arrogance. However, in this context, this is not the vibe I was getting and I felt that this point was actually more profound than that in the context of mental health.Moreover, for this part:No one thinks you “owe” them anything, they’re trying to make a difference in any small way and TBH this is a very self-centered post.This is the problem in and of itself.  This comes across a bit as asking for an ""ideal victim""/respectability politics. Yes, it may be ""self-centered"". But....to be frank, a lot of mental health ins ""unsexy""----there are self-centered aspects to anxiety, depression, etc. It affects your relationships with others. It isolates you from people. You snap. You get irritable. You take stuff out on others when you don't mean to, you can be distrustful, and so on. This is kind of the point, of you know, why it's an illness that needs treatment. Moreover, it can feel more isolating for some people when they're being nice when you're a stranger/number, but then they won't talk to you in class at all and act rude.Let me give a concrete example (with racism instead of mental health):There was this horrible girl on my floor, my first year here who always kept virtue signalling about how not ""racist"" she is, how she's ""basically black because she's poor"", and so on. She would call people out all the time. But....she also wouldn't talk to me, and she also bullied and belittled me the entire time there. Later, I made another friend who revealed to me that she knew this girl----and this girl literally called them the n word one time and called them ""ugly and black"".Actually, when I was physically ill and had to move out, this girl kept trying to ""check in"" on me but in actuality she was gossipping. I knew better from her behavior with other people, not to say anything directly to her.When you see stuff like this, you get jaded. This applies to basically anything social-justice related (racism, sexism, mental health, whatever you could possibly think of)---some people use it as an opportunity to post platitudes but it just....doesn't match in their daily life.Yes, it is uncharitable to others because honestly, probably a plurality of the people posting notes and doing whatever they can ARE being genuine----but their hands are tied, and it's hard to reach out directly. Maybe some of the people posting are putting their energy out there in hopes someone will reciprocate as well. There are entire shades of grey between black and white ""OP's post is selfish"", ""these people are fake"", etc. Two things can be true at once, and I think that your approach in this comment here was a bit uncharitable in and of itself, as they expressed specifically why it bothers them and the loneliness they're feeling.What this post is about is touching on a wider culture problem, with the ""wall"" that u/sweetypantz mentioned that's part of the culture here, and more specifically, part of the modern culture. As I mentioned previously as well, it's jarring as there is an incongruency between these messages and then daily life where kids are quite competitive and standoffish towards each other.  If you are young, this can make you cynical. I see it differently myself just by life experience and the fact that I'm not *that* young, and I'm not a first year coming up against this for the first time. But some people are, and for them, it will feel like they're screaming into the void.The problem, in my opinion, is the ideology and culture *itself* behind the mental health epidemic here to begin with. We are atomized and put into a hierarchal/competitive environment, and the approach to mental health has been an individualistic approach which I think is incorrect---ie, ""YOU are ill, YOU need to do this, YOU need to breathe, YOU need to take care"". And I think it's wrong, because it would be one thing if just a couple of people were ill----but when the whole community has such a high rate of mental health issues? No way it's just an individual thing, it's a symptom of a bigger problem that affects waaay more people.I often see calls for ""self-care""----what we also need is community care, we need collaboration, we need to be told it's okay to not be okay, and we need to break away from toxic positivity and towards a more balanced view of a real human emotional life. It feels like students get treated like robots with on and off buttons. And I think this was the most profound point that OP was getting at, specifically here:“Everything sad is going to come untrue,” oh okay—thanks. It just makes me feel more stressed, “don’t give up,” just feels like another responsibility stacked upon the others.I've felt this myself, not only with mental health issues, but physical health issues. I finally got diagnosed with a heart related issue (POTS) and they found a blood related issue as well, and this was after an ER visit. But before, the responsibility was unfairly put on me and I was told to do ""breathing exercises"", ""meditation"" whenever I would have fainting spells and very high heart rates (sometimes reaching 200) because it was concluded before looking at all my symptoms (hypotension), that my high heart rate was due to ""anxiety"". I had to withdraw so many things and I'll graduate at a later age than my peers because of how many disruptions I've had chasing down the wrong problem because people wouldn't diagnose me correctly, and then proceeded to put the onus solely on me to fix my heart rate with ""breathing"" (that actually made it worse). No one until recently really bothered to look (and it was because of the work of my sweet father that I was able to get any help). This was horrendously frustrating and I felt super useless when I kept trying those breathing, yoga, meditation exercises and it just made it worse.If this can happen with a physical issue, imagine what happens with a mental health issue. Especially if you already feel useless and then people treat you like you're non-compliant when you're doing the best you can.",11 upvotes

behavioral health,/user/clueinc/,UNC 2022,"I tried my best to explain that my opinion isn’t a ‘catch all’. I know that great people/advocates exist at any college, including UNC. When you consider the subculture of a college, you take into account the majority however. I would say that schools like Duke also experience similar problems, but it’s almost offset due to other reasons (money, connections, prestige, etc.) which would be a sociology paper on its own. I’m not say I know anything really, just given recent events this seems most likely to me.Experiencing drastic change with mental health issues can be devastating. If these were all first years I wouldn’t be surprised since I attempted my first year as well, and another student my year wasn’t as fortunate as me. I can speak from my experience that I definitely felt isolated, and my point more so with this was that UNC’s subculture can make students feel isolated on a mass scale compared to other campuses (due to the elitist/competitive nature)I can’t speak for them, nor should I, but even if what I’m saying isn’t true for NT individuals, those with declining mental health aren’t going to be rational, and will see campus behavior as more persecutory.Again, this isn’t my specialty, I’ve only learned a thing or two in therapy and SOC",10 upvotes
behavioral health,/user/Lady_Caticorn/,UNC 2022,"There is scientific evidence that lots of media reporting on suicides can cause copy-cat behavior or suicide clusters to occur.

behavioral health,/user/BigUwuBaby/,UNC 2022,"I get your concern. I do. However, I think there are a lot of things in your post you could rethink, and I'm saying this as someone not affliated with the A2F community in any shape or form, nor have I been a regular member of any Christian community for the past 5 years. The long post I'm following up here is not to bash you specifically, but to try to address as many of the points you raised as possible, especially given the severity of the allegations you bring up.I would really caution against assuming negative intent out of the things you've mentioned, and try avoid bias because some people come from a certain group. Just about every group with some history has had some blot in their past -- this doesn't mean the entire group is guilty, nor does it mean that every individual from that group has an inclination for some sin. The Catholic church for example has had many allegations against them, including with grooming and embezzlement; does that mean you should think of every Catholic as someone with who might touch kids and steal money? I get if that's not your intention, but your wording in this post just seems to imply something along those lines of group bias.Out of the observations you mentioned:Church planting is an incredibly common practice in any large fellowship, and especially among minority communities, you'll see a network of churches that are connected via former leaders/members that have relocated. It does not mean those churches or communities are closely affiliated, as you'll see with A2F's community and its neighbor Asian American churches.People in the community would naturally want to grow their community, especially for religions like Christianity, where one of the primary missions of Christian doctrine is to evangelize. Older members being active in that process is not necessarily a red flag, given that this is also common behavior you see in just about any other Christian fellowship, particularly in college.Peer pressure, particularly among social groups, is a natural phenomenon for any social group. A group becoming ""difficult to leave"" is not something you see exclusive to A2F, especially for younger college students who are just beginning to explore themselves. It helps to extend your friend group beyond a single community to relieve that pressure and give you diverse perspectives.Keeping genders separate is something I agree can be a borderline sexist practice, and I think it's something that can be alienting for gender non-conforming groups. I'm not a big fan of it, but it doesn't mean it isn't common, and it especially doesn't mean that it is a red flag, other than the group having a more ""traditional"" culture. This practice in of itself is something I've found to be practiced at almost every minority fellowship I've been in (not just Asian/AsAm). The primary justification I've heard for it, particularly for small groups, is that it gives the younger ones some role models that are better suited for the things they're experiencing.Having/purchasing vans to carpool students is something that is also common for larger college fellowships. Leaders being alumni is also fairly common. Members being roommates is also incredibly common in a lot of communities, not just A2F or Christian ones.I agree as Christians, one's identity should not belong to a specific community, but to God. I also agree that it's important to make well-informed decisions, to prioritize safety and health above all else. I also think it's important to consider these issues from multiple perspectives. I don't personally consider any of the things you brought up regarding UNC's A2F community a red (or even yellow) flag, but that's based off of the things you strictly described in your post and my own experience with many churches over the years.Again, I'm not a member of A2F, and I don't consider myself an active Christian either. I'm just here to provide some counterperspective.",6 upvotes
behavioral health,/user/sailor_rini/,Alum,"I'd be honestly very curious to hear from students why some think curriculum is so ridiculous here. It seems pretty standard from my experiences at other universities and even slightly easier than my undergrad.This might be field dependant though. I had really good experiences with language departments. For example, I had some good professors for flexibility when there was some type of issue (shoutout to the Russian department), and some good experiences with the stats major (flexibility when I got covid). I've also had bad  experiences in the math major and the stats major,  particularly for chronic (not acute like covid) illnesses. I have some heart/blood-related issues and I basically need assistance from parents to get around places  (to avoid falling on something and the resulting blunt force trauma), and so I reached out to some professors who more or less told me it sucks to suck and that I should withdraw and I didn't really feel heard. I've known several of my peers, from a whole range of ages, who have similar experiences (from 18 year old freshmen to back to school mid 30s). Many of us are transfers as well, and have different experiences and it's jarring coming here. I feel like this is different in languages or social sciences, but for some of the STEM subjects some of the instructors can be quite cold and mechanical in their responses, and not particularly sympathetic.  I have so much anxiety around being physically ill because from past experiences, I'm expected to basically just ""eat the loss"" with the classes/instructors I've taken.  I've also seen some policies in the beginning of the semester that my medically fragile father was deeply uncomfortable with due to the risk of covid/my bringing back covid or getting it since I myself am also medically fragile. These policies include not posting the notes in case class is missed/relying on other students, not having remote options, lack of flexibility in case someone has symptoms and should stay home . I've even seen some particularly egregious cases which mandatory attendance, and quite frankly, this is....not the time for that, as some of us really cannot afford being shoulder-to-shoulder with sick students who came to class, and getting sick ourselves in this pandemic world. I understand encouraging students to come to class, but I feel that health and safety is also important and there shouldn't be a penalty on people (students,as well as whole entire families and communities) for basically not being able-bodied enough.  Again, some departments very much do not do this (the Russian department again, does things correctly) but other departments are behind the times. With some departments as well, I'd say there is decent evidence of institutional ableism (not just for undergrads).Additionally:As someone in charge of grading and some teaching, this is the one place I could have influence, and honestly, if we curve exams anymore than we already are, we might as well just give out all As. And they are already open book, open note, and open talking to other studentsThe curved exams are way worse than the uncurved exams in maths---it's usually curved at the end so it can be difficult to tell where you stand (which can increase anxiety), and sometimes I feel like curving is over-relied upon and it basically becomes normalized to have harder-than-reasonable exams. Usually, students feel better when a curve is not announced ahead of time because that typically means the exam is more reasonable.Also my math exams have consistently been closed everything, still, even with the pandemic and of course after the fact.  Also this is kind of instructor-dependant as well, on top of being department-dependant. I've had a couple of wonderful, sympathetic instructors but it gets lost in a sea of instructors who are unsympathetic and do not hide their contempt about teaching undergraduate classes--because the one lovely instructor becomes a shining light in a sea of bad professors/the general culture is still bad even if the individual is good. I'd also add there are some systemic issues related to equity here but that could be its own post.Moreover,  I'd add that sometimes it's not even the curriculum for undergrads, but also for grad students as well as toxic PI's if you are doing research. I have a peer who's doing swimmingly in her grad school now doing engineering, after having a bad time with UNC undergrad (math/bio double major) and is headed for NASA. She had bad experiences with people she did lab work or research under and just honestly really toxic behavior.",6 upvotes

Or just simply be considerate of others. The loss is not only lives it’s livelihoods, long term health, careers, and educational opportunities.

behavioral health,,,"I don't think that Emory is worth ~7k a year more than UNC, and personally I would choose UNC if the costs were equal (but I'm not you). Medical school is expensive and you should shoot for the cheaper option for undergrad.UNC offers strong opportunities in Biology and Public Health. Imo, many pre-meds should pursue one of the BSPH offerings instead of a BS in Biology or Chemistry. Yes, admissions to Gillings is competitive, but so is medical school.UNC is touted as one of the best values in the country. I agree with this.I would say that the student culture is collaborative, but competitive. People want to do better than their peers, but I have not heard or experienced any ""cutthroat behaviors"" that I have heard of from other schools. Most classes nowadays have a GroupMe or similar group chat and if you have a question about something your peers will help you out.I like the ""college town"" vibe and most of the colleges I applied to are ""college towns"". Chapel Hill is strongly centered around the university, and Carolina Blue is a common sight. I like the vibe of Franklin Street and the many restaurants there. Carrboro is right next door and also has some cool places. Major social activities are generally focused around sports (going to a game, tailgating, etc.), and UNC's football team has greatly improved over the past 2 seasons, and UNC is projected by many to be a Top 10 team with a Heisman Trophy contender in Sam Howell. Men's basketball is the ""traditional UNC sport"", but the past 2 seasons have been lacking. However, optimism is high with new coach Hubert Davis. Coach Davis has made some moves I like and I think that the basketball team will show a great deal of improvement next season. Emory is a Division III school without the national Division I athletic profile, and I'm not sure if they are any good at the Division III level. You might've not liked sports in high school, but Carolina football and basketball are a much different experience. Many people learn to love going to games as a Carolina student.As a note, while there is a ""Pro-UNC"" bias in this sub, there is also some ""anti-UNC"" bias in this sub, especially at this time of the year (end of the semester/post-finals). Some people had a rough go of it this semester and vent on here (nothing wrong with a healthy vent, I support it), and I feel like they are overrepresented on this sub when compared to the entire university. I mean most people don't go on reddit to announce that they got a high GPA this semester and aced their finals. I do believe that there are some flawed classes and poor instructors at UNC, but by reading RMP reviews, talking to people, etc. you can avoid these instructors and/or classes. You might have to bite the bullet one semester and take a flawed class and/or poor instructor, but that is present at virtually every university, and anyone who claims otherwise got lucky or they are lying.Also I would tend to listen to the advice of students and alumni over other people that might be bouncing around this thread. There are a couple of people bouncing around this sub that have some sort of bone to pick with the university and have nothing positive to say about UNC. Even the most critical students and alumni have *something* they liked about the university, but these people (who have never attended UNC) have nothing positive to say.",6 upvotes

Real, beneficial changes are made when better access to long-term, PROFESSIONAL help is made more widely available. Everyone wants to help when there’s an acute crisis, but take it from someone who works with those suffering from severe mental health illnesses on a daily basis in increments of 12 hour shifts. When the going gets really tough and you’re reversing ODs with narcan while getting yacked all over, holding down violent patients who are a threat to not only themselves but others in order to get them medicated, and actively stopping some from committing suicide in a clinical setting and helping them process those emotions they’re facing after the fact, not many people want to get together and hug it out. A sad many are left to their own devices by family and friends to be treated without as much as a call or visit. The “concern” trying to be shown from others by requesting an extra day off(?) to somehow show they care comes off as exorbitantly shallow and misguided.

Try to go to games and events even if you aren’t the biggest fan of sports. It’s just part of the Carolina experience. Try your best to make friends in different areas of your life, i.e. friends in your dorm, your major, classes, clubs, so you don’t always spend your time doing the same things with the same people. Don’t stress so much about your academics. Barely anyone gets a 4.0 and unless that is something you truly, deeply value, it is not worth the mental health damage it causes (not to say don’t try in school, academics are still important).

Please note that instructors may not hold class, administer tests or other assessments, collect papers or assign new work on this day. Additionally, this wellness day falls just before the University’s spring holiday on April 15, and we hope that students will take advantage of this extended break. While we would have liked to have added more wellness days for spring 2022, this year’s academic calendar simply could not accommodate it.

mental health,/user/HAPPEEnatl/,Parent,"Oh honey, I'm so very sorry that you are going through this. Have you tried reaching out to CAPS? If not, please do asap! I'm really proud of you for reaching out here for help - I know it takes more emotional and mental energy than it feels like you have available at a time of crisis like this. So already you are heading in the right direction. 🥰Unfortunately, I don't know the best thing for you to do. However, as far as what grad schools would think if you take off a semester - or even a year or more - to get the help you need and deserve and then come back stronger to finish undergrad, they'll think you are resilient and mature and motivated enough to achieve your goals even when it is really, really tough.Everyone has their own path. Some people are lucky enough to have an easier path than others (although of course everyone has struggles that aren't obvious), but those whose path is tougher actually get the benefits of surviving that path in the end. They have a better perspective on life and everything in it, they are more confident because they know they can keep going when times are tough, they are better equipped for their adult lives because they've already figured out what resources they need in a crisis, where to find them, and are now comfortable accessing them. They also know who stuck by them in the tough times, and therefore what true friendship and love look and feel like. Those on an easy path don't learn any of those things until they are much older, which incidentally makes them far less effective as, for example, school psychologists. And of course, you will have a better understanding and far more empathy for your clients than you would otherwise have had since you will have lived through this particular struggle.When you get to be my age (""old"") and have seen as many psychiatrists, psychologists, and other therapists as I have, you will long since have realized that people in those professions are often there because of their serious emotional and mental health struggles in life, not in spite of them. In other words, you honestly will fit right in, both in grad school and in the profession.So please, prioritize your mental health. You CAN get through this, and although it really sucks right now, this will be great preparation for your career. Your figuring out how to navigate this situation will benefit countless students in the future. You are going to be an AMAZING school psychologist some day, especially if you take care of yourself along the way.Finally, I'm so very, very sorry about your family. PLEASE come see us at Hugs & Pups - in fact, we'll have two teams on campus today from ~2-3:30 (btw our visits to campus are always announced on our social media accounts beforehand, including r/HAPPEE_HugsandPups).

mental health,/user/dannyboi1835/,UNC 2023,"First of all, I’m really sorry you feel so overwhelmed right now. Last spring, I felt pretty much the same way—classes became such a burden for me because of my mental illnesses intensifying, and I began to feel like there was no way out of the mess I’d put myself in by falling behind in school.I decided to go to CAPS right toward the end of the semester and spoke to them about a withdrawal from classes for psychological reasons. Basically, they can do it at any point during the semester (at least until finals start), and your semester is wiped entirely clear. You would lose access to university services (things which your student fees cover) until you returned to school, but it is a way to wipe the slate clean if that’s what you need. You can then return at the start of whichever semester you choose, as long as you get cleared to return by a doctor 6-8 weeks before that semester starts.I didn’t have to deal with the housing aspect too seriously, but if you really need to stay in your house for the rest of the semester, you could potentially just wait until the end of classes to seek psychological withdrawal (it doesn’t make a difference to your transcript whether you do it early or late in the semester).Lastly, I just want to say that the opportunity that this option afforded me really helped me change my life for the better. I felt completely trapped by school while my mental health deteriorated, and being able to leave with no academic consequences was such a weight off my shoulders. I withdrew in Spring 2022, worked full-time over the summer and fall semester, and met so many people through my job that helped me put school and life into a new context. Everyone I met had a different educational background and were taking different paths to get to their goals, and that’s ok. I was inspired to find joy in the journey, rather than view it as a means to a destination where I could be happy. Now, I’m back at UNC this semester, looking to graduate next spring, and feeling much better in myself, happier in my life, and less stressed about the future.Sometimes giving yourself the time and space to get better is the best thing you can do for yourself. I don’t think I’d be back on track (mentally or academically) the way I am now if it wasn’t for the time I took away from school, and that’s something to keep in mind as you weigh up what taking time off might mean for grad school prospects. I certainly think that wiping off a semester where your grades are likely to be poor and coming back at a time when you’re more prepared to succeed in classes would look better than continuing on while your grades and mental health suffer. Obviously, not every situation is the same, and you have to make the choice that makes the most sense for you, but know that going this way is an option.I truly hope you are able to find a solution that works for you and that you start feeling better as soon as possible. If you need to talk, either for more info about my withdrawal, or just for support, I’m always free to listen.",8 upvotes
mental health,/user/Kelter1313/,UNC 2023,"Tips to set yourself up for post college while you're here :Start interning early (first semester as a freshman)!!! Or applying at least! Obviously opportunities vary by field, but you miss every shot you don't take. An early ""meh"" internship is a gateway to a ""good"" internship the next year and a gateway to your dream job / internship the next year. I recommend the Virtual Student Federal Service for impressive federal internships with a low barrier to entry. It's unpaid, but it's 10 hours max a week, interesting work, and remote so you can easily balance it with school and leverage it to get a better, paid internship later on. They also have work in everything from computer science, to environmental science, Poli sci, business, economics, natural Sciences, language, you name it in agencies ranging from NOAA, State, DOD, Treasury, Transport and more! That can be leveraged to get an interview and as a talking point for interviews into a paid, nicer internship with higher entry difficulty in either public or private sector!Consider getting a job on campus that pays for your housing. Most scholarships (check with yours) let you keep the extra money. RCCs get money for a double room to do basic IT work on campus (on paper, ten hours a week, reality is two if even), while RAs get paid an okay amount above the cost of a single room and get a discount on that room too. The value of this is it lets you save up a decent ""nest egg"" of emergency / grad school money for your early life post college!Look into internship funding when you intern over a summer, UNC has a pool of it and most anyone can go for it!!!Last but not least, have fun in college! This is a time of growth! Volunteer to help or go to conferences, join clubs, make friends with a diverse group of people! Do it all!!! I know my advice here is professional, but even with all this you should maintain a healthy social life.

mental health,/user/Wafleo/,Mod | UNC 2024 (Public Health + Pre-Med),"i think there’s a massive mental health crisis going on, especially with younger people affected by the pandemic, and that obviously includes students here at UNC. I would say i’m ~actually~ stressed about 25% of the time during the semester and the other 75% is just the underlying stress of school, extracurriculars, and the general shit we gotta do as humans. I’m affiliated with ARS for ADHD, but I have never used on-campus resources for my mental health. I’ve never struggled with it enough to warrant that, but I can attribute my sanity to having a great support system, understanding professors (some would say it’s rare here, but personally i’ve found that to be mostly untrue except for chem lmao), and having good study habits/routines.I think a big reason why college students are struggling so much with mental health is the disappointment of what they expected college to be: making friends, having the best time of your life, being independent, figuring out their passions etc. Students’ study habits dropped considerably from COVID, and the return to in person learning shocked so many when school got hard again. When neither of those things go to plan, people often feel like they’re failing college socially and academically. Then to top it off, there’s the existential dread of not knowing what they want to do with their lives after college.That being said, UNC isn’t doing enough about it.

School in general is touch especially when everyone has different backgrounds and circumstances that very much dictate their education experiences.

It took a little time but probably about a year and a half later, I felt at a point I could go back. So I did. I went back to college and got my degree.I still had to heavily explore my mental health even after that and unfortunately did have two attempts that hospitalized me. But as bad as it went and my life literally falling apart, it got better. I learnt a lot about myself, I learned what my support network was and what I needed, I learned how to set boundaries and come to an understanding with myself.

But PLEASE don't think you're a failure and there's nothing good about you. Please do not do that. I know it's easier said than done, trust me, I'm still struggling with it every now and then.

I kept trying to talk myself out of pursuing other things because I kept telling myself it wasn’t practical to the career I was working towards.I ended up adding a minor (which I have since upgraded to double-major) in something I loved and was passionate about, even if it wasn’t “practical”. Being able to take classes in something I was in love with alongside the classes I was “eh” on did wonders for my motivation in both subjects because, while sometimes there was “toil and drudgery”, I had stuff to look forward to, but I still felt like I had a bit of security and that I wasn’t taking an employment gamble, so to speak, because I could pursue either one and had a degree that isn’t as risky. Yes, it’s more work, but it’s work I ADORE doing. And it sounds like stuff related to game dev might invoke that feeling for you.So, here’s what I’d say: you’ve put a lot of effort and time into biology.

That ""limit"" doesn't reset, meaning that even though that was in the first year of my MPH, I don't get any additional help in the PhD despite technically graduating then coming back.Beyond that they can* refer you to outside sources. However, those outside services will usually charge, though they will theoretically be familiar with places that take the student BCBS insurance.(*) - I have asked CAPS for referrals for several different reasons (CBT for anxiety in-network on Student Blue in the Triangle, psychoeducational evaluation or medication management in the Charlotte area where UNC-CH has an official research installation) and they have literally never been able to refer me to an appropriate provider.

If you live in Granville you can purchase a parking permit there, although they are not guaranteed for freshman. Aside from buses, UNC has bicycle racks around campus where you get a free hour each day on the bike, and after that you pay a fee.I have not had issues with large class sizes. Office hours and recitations allow for you to get that ""small setting vibe"" if you need it. I liked the FYS course I took and was able to make a strong connection with the professor. A word of warning, I think some people oversell FYS courses as automatic A's. That is untrue, and some of them can be a PITA.

But having taken that option for this semester, I feel like I can more or less start a fresh slate, take this summer to take good care of myself, seek help, do things I enjoy, and come back in the fall refreshed and re-motivated.Not sure if your situation warrants a step that drastic (you could always talk to CAPS and academic advising about it to see what they say, but it would have to be in the works before LDOC ends tomorrow), but all of this is to say that how you’re feeling about and performing in school is only temporary and doesn’t define or control your life. I’m horrible at asking for help, but I’ve learned that it really is important if your mental health is suffering. And at the end of the day, your life has worth outside of school and your achievements. Take time for yourself, do things you enjoy, and hopefully the rest will fall into place. Really wishing you all the best.",15 upvotes

mental illness,/user/throwaway112505/,UNC Class of 2016,"Sounds like things have only gotten significantly worse since I was a student. Here's a little snapshot example of how stuff played out for me:I developed an eating disorder as a student, probably due to the stressful environment. For context, eating disorders affect like half of all college students and are the #1 most deadly mental illness.The campus dietician was super helpful. But she also said I really need to see a therapist but that CAPS resources for my situation were extremely overwhelmed, so I would need to find my own therapist somewhere else.I couldn't have a car on campus and was too busy with my daily class schedule + studying for the one exam and one quiz that I had EVERY single week of the semester. So, I didn't feel like I had the time or resources for therapy and didn't go. Recovery on my own was horrible.I did see CAPS the previous year for issues with adjusting to college life and it was extremely unhelpful. Everyone says to go to CAPS if you need help, so I was pretty discouraged and left feeling a little lost. I've seen several helpful therapists later in life and now realize just how bad my CAPS therapist was.Major issues:CAPS needs more funding and higher quality resources.Some classes are designed to be overly difficult to weed students out. I literally heard professors say (in a conversation amongst themselves) that that were trying to weed specific types of students out of their classes. When they solicited feedback mid-semester because the class was going SO poorly, they said that all the problems we brought up in our feedback were our fault and that they wouldn't be implementing any of our suggestions. All of this is just ridiculous.Majors need to be designed with job outcomes in mind. Things don't need to be overly difficult for no reason. Courses need to align with the current job market. Students need to feel like their education will actually help them achieve their goals after college.They need to dedicate a chunk of new student orientation, Week of Welcome, and dorm events to mental health. And I don't mean puppies and pizza. Real discussions of mental health problems that may be specific to college life and how to approach them with real strategies. For example, I learned a lot of skills in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (a decade late lol) that can be useful in a variety of situations.",49 upvotes

mental illness,/user/sweetypantz/,PhD Candidate,"I understand where you’re coming from but being turned away from CAPS truly almost led to a mental health crisis for me. It was invalidating and frankly soul crushing. I was told my anxiety was not out of the ordinary. I didn’t seek help for a while and just suffered with my mental illness until my body literally started failing me with panic attacks daily.I was new here and WISH I knew at the time that this resource was underfunded and lacked compassion. I would have looked elsewhere right then. By all means please try CAPS, but THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS if you are turned away from care. I also could have saved myself shame for being told my issues are not worthy of care. A year later, I asked around and found a therapist off 54 that took my insurance and DID NOT REQUIRE A REFERRAL.I always thought you needed a referral and you don’t, can go directly to Psychologytoday.com to find options for counselors (email or call 3-6+ and leave a message). Also now with places like betterhelp.com or talkspace.com, my friends have benefited from online therapy (super easy). If needed, you can go to your campus health doctor for depression/anxiety and they can assess whether a medication prescription will help you. Medication can help the therapy process IF your doctor thinks it can help and it is hard to function daily. It helped me see life more objectively for 6 or so months. I was lucky my campus health doc was so helpful and also recommended an amazing therapist to me later.Please keep trying!Edits with more info",36 upvotes

mental illness,/user/sailor_rini/,Alum,"Okay, now that I'm awake, I wanted to address this comment specifically (and I initially had this reaction to the title as well, until I read). I see your point, but quite frankly, this is part of the problem, and seems to deny the concept of virtue-signalling altogether which is what I believe OP is getting at.  I do see your point in that sometimes accusations of ""virtue signalling"" can be unfair, and often are virtue signals in and of themselves. And I've called someone out before for precisely that, as it came across as a belief that only ""they"" are the moral ones and everyone else is a ""virtue signaller"", which is arrogance. However, in this context, this is not the vibe I was getting and I felt that this point was actually more profound than that in the context of mental health.Moreover, for this part:No one thinks you “owe” them anything, they’re trying to make a difference in any small way and TBH this is a very self-centered post.This is the problem in and of itself.  This comes across a bit as asking for an ""ideal victim""/respectability politics. Yes, it may be ""self-centered"". But....to be frank, a lot of mental health ins ""unsexy""----there are self-centered aspects to anxiety, depression, etc. It affects your relationships with others. It isolates you from people. You snap. You get irritable. You take stuff out on others when you don't mean to, you can be distrustful, and so on. This is kind of the point, of you know, why it's an illness that needs treatment. Moreover, it can feel more isolating for some people when they're being nice when you're a stranger/number, but then they won't talk to you in class at all and act rude.Let me give a concrete example (with racism instead of mental health):There was this horrible girl on my floor, my first year here who always kept virtue signalling about how not ""racist"" she is, how she's ""basically black because she's poor"", and so on. She would call people out all the time. But....she also wouldn't talk to me, and she also bullied and belittled me the entire time there. Later, I made another friend who revealed to me that she knew this girl----and this girl literally called them the n word one time and called them ""ugly and black"".Actually, when I was physically ill and had to move out, this girl kept trying to ""check in"" on me but in actuality she was gossipping. I knew better from her behavior with other people, not to say anything directly to her.When you see stuff like this, you get jaded. This applies to basically anything social-justice related (racism, sexism, mental health, whatever you could possibly think of)---some people use it as an opportunity to post platitudes but it just....doesn't match in their daily life.Yes, it is uncharitable to others because honestly, probably a plurality of the people posting notes and doing whatever they can ARE being genuine----but their hands are tied, and it's hard to reach out directly. Maybe some of the people posting are putting their energy out there in hopes someone will reciprocate as well. There are entire shades of grey between black and white ""OP's post is selfish"", ""these people are fake"", etc. Two things can be true at once, and I think that your approach in this comment here was a bit uncharitable in and of itself, as they expressed specifically why it bothers them and the loneliness they're feeling.What this post is about is touching on a wider culture problem, with the ""wall"" that u/sweetypantz mentioned that's part of the culture here, and more specifically, part of the modern culture. As I mentioned previously as well, it's jarring as there is an incongruency between these messages and then daily life where kids are quite competitive and standoffish towards each other.  If you are young, this can make you cynical. I see it differently myself just by life experience and the fact that I'm not *that* young, and I'm not a first year coming up against this for the first time. But some people are, and for them, it will feel like they're screaming into the void.The problem, in my opinion, is the ideology and culture *itself* behind the mental health epidemic here to begin with. We are atomized and put into a hierarchal/competitive environment, and the approach to mental health has been an individualistic approach which I think is incorrect---ie, ""YOU are ill, YOU need to do this, YOU need to breathe, YOU need to take care"". And I think it's wrong, because it would be one thing if just a couple of people were ill----but when the whole community has such a high rate of mental health issues? No way it's just an individual thing, it's a symptom of a bigger problem that affects waaay more people.I often see calls for ""self-care""----what we also need is community care, we need collaboration, we need to be told it's okay to not be okay, and we need to break away from toxic positivity and towards a more balanced view of a real human emotional life. It feels like students get treated like robots with on and off buttons. And I think this was the most profound point that OP was getting at, specifically here:“Everything sad is going to come untrue,” oh okay—thanks. It just makes me feel more stressed, “don’t give up,” just feels like another responsibility stacked upon the others.I've felt this myself, not only with mental health issues, but physical health issues. I finally got diagnosed with a heart related issue (POTS) and they found a blood related issue as well, and this was after an ER visit. But before, the responsibility was unfairly put on me and I was told to do ""breathing exercises"", ""meditation"" whenever I would have fainting spells and very high heart rates (sometimes reaching 200) because it was concluded before looking at all my symptoms (hypotension), that my high heart rate was due to ""anxiety"". I had to withdraw so many things and I'll graduate at a later age than my peers because of how many disruptions I've had chasing down the wrong problem because people wouldn't diagnose me correctly, and then proceeded to put the onus solely on me to fix my heart rate with ""breathing"" (that actually made it worse). No one until recently really bothered to look (and it was because of the work of my sweet father that I was able to get any help). This was horrendously frustrating and I felt super useless when I kept trying those breathing, yoga, meditation exercises and it just made it worse.If this can happen with a physical issue, imagine what happens with a mental health issue. Especially if you already feel useless and then people treat you like you're non-compliant when you're doing the best you can.",11 upvotes
mental illness,/user/poppyseed008/,Mod | Graduate Student,"Yeah, I don't like the whole ""lol you don't"" thing because declining mental health varies vastly in severity among different people. Being in a tough spot mentally might be manageable for someone without mental illness, but it's potentially life-threatening for someone with mental illness, or just anyone prone to severe symptoms of mental health struggles. We've seen that last semester, and it was awful. Your mental health is worth prioritizing.I wish I had more advice, but I'm a transfer and this is the first year I've felt like I even kind of have my shit together. The biggest thing for me has been realizing that struggling does not have to equal bad grades. There are accommodations in place for you, and my experience with asking for accommodations have been vastly positive. Ideally, you'll take some of the suggestions here and not reach this point, but if you find yourself having difficulty getting out of bed for instance, email your instructors. I sufferred quite a bit from that specific symptom and ended up getting a 9/10 for participation for a recitation I missed quite a bit; because I told the TA why, met with him to catch up, and did participate when I could show up. You don't have to convince yourself that you're going to fail a course because things are difficult - that's just going to worsen your mental health. I have actually never asked for an extension and even incomplete and been told no. That's not to say that it doesn't happen, but this is in STEM class as well, so it's probably going to happen way less often than you think.TLDR; tell your professors if you're going through shit, and you probably won't make bad grades.",8 upvotes

mental illness,/user/hot-spot-hooligan/,UNC 2023,"Dear Carolina Community:Today, on World Mental Health Day, we are taking a moment to acknowledge and reflect on the seriousness of mental health illness and the challenges we face as we wrestle with the stress and pressures of our world today. We are in the middle of a mental health crisis, both on our campus and across our nation, and we are aware that college-aged students carry an increased risk of suicide. This crisis has directly impacted members of our community – especially with the passing of two students on campus in the past month. As chancellor, a professor and a parent, my heart breaks for all those whose suffering goes unnoticed.After meeting with student and faculty leaders over the weekend, I am announcing a Wellness Day for our students on Tuesday, Oct. 12, as a step in addressing mental health. Classes will be canceled. I encourage every student to use this time to rest and to check in with each other during that day. Reach out to a friend, a classmate, or colleague and ask them, “honestly, how are you doing?” We will still recognize University Day at 2 p.m. in Memorial Hall as planned.We will also draw on the robust expertise from across our campus, including Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and School of Social Work to create a special support network starting Tuesday and throughout the week. They will be available for our students, faculty and staff in different areas of campus for those who need connection to resources and a place to process and talk about their experiences. We will provide more information on this tomorrow, and we encourage anyone who needs this resource to participate.We will also convene a mental health summit later this month bringing together faculty, staff, and student leaders. Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, Assad Meymandi Distinguished Professor and chair of the psychiatry department in the School of Medicine, has agreed to lead this effort. Faculty, staff, students and campus leaders must work together to address this national crisis.In the coming weeks, we will launch the Heels Care Network, a campus-wide campaign to promote and support mental health awareness, which requires all of us to play an important role. Check in with your colleagues and students regarding how they are doing. If you are concerned about someone, let us know. We will have as part of the Heels Care Network a reporting mechanism for you to share information about someone you believe needs help. Look for more information about the Heels Care Network and the mental health summit soon.At Carolina, we strive to put our students first in everything we do. We are living in a world that is constantly shifting and changing. We are facing major challenges and the ongoing toll this takes on our health cannot be underestimated. This cannot be solved by one person, or on one day, alone.If you need assistance during this time, please reach out to any of these departments that stand ready to help. Students, including graduate and professional students and postdocs, please contact Counseling and Psychological Services, the Dean of Students team or Student Wellness. For students who live on-campus, you have built-in support systems in your Carolina Housing staff. Reach out to them and let them know how they can help. Resources are also available through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-8255) and the Crisis Text Line (Text START to 741-741).We recognize that these issues are not for students only. Mental health applies to all of us. Faculty and staff who need support should reach out to the Employee Assistance Program.The most important thing we can do is to care for each other, and I hope you continue to do this on Tuesday and for the rest of this year and beyond. Remember, our caring Carolina community is our best asset to get through this crisis together.Sincerely,Kevin M.

mental illness,/user/dannyboi1835/,UNC 2023,"First of all, I’m really sorry you feel so overwhelmed right now. Last spring, I felt pretty much the same way—classes became such a burden for me because of my mental illnesses intensifying, and I began to feel like there was no way out of the mess I’d put myself in by falling behind in school.I decided to go to CAPS right toward the end of the semester and spoke to them about a withdrawal from classes for psychological reasons. Basically, they can do it at any point during the semester (at least until finals start), and your semester is wiped entirely clear. You would lose access to university services (things which your student fees cover) until you returned to school, but it is a way to wipe the slate clean if that’s what you need. You can then return at the start of whichever semester you choose, as long as you get cleared to return by a doctor 6-8 weeks before that semester starts.I didn’t have to deal with the housing aspect too seriously, but if you really need to stay in your house for the rest of the semester, you could potentially just wait until the end of classes to seek psychological withdrawal (it doesn’t make a difference to your transcript whether you do it early or late in the semester).Lastly, I just want to say that the opportunity that this option afforded me really helped me change my life for the better. I felt completely trapped by school while my mental health deteriorated, and being able to leave with no academic consequences was such a weight off my shoulders. I withdrew in Spring 2022, worked full-time over the summer and fall semester, and met so many people through my job that helped me put school and life into a new context. Everyone I met had a different educational background and were taking different paths to get to their goals, and that’s ok. I was inspired to find joy in the journey, rather than view it as a means to a destination where I could be happy. Now, I’m back at UNC this semester, looking to graduate next spring, and feeling much better in myself, happier in my life, and less stressed about the future.Sometimes giving yourself the time and space to get better is the best thing you can do for yourself. I don’t think I’d be back on track (mentally or academically) the way I am now if it wasn’t for the time I took away from school, and that’s something to keep in mind as you weigh up what taking time off might mean for grad school prospects. I certainly think that wiping off a semester where your grades are likely to be poor and coming back at a time when you’re more prepared to succeed in classes would look better than continuing on while your grades and mental health suffer. Obviously, not every situation is the same, and you have to make the choice that makes the most sense for you, but know that going this way is an option.I truly hope you are able to find a solution that works for you and that you start feeling better as soon as possible.

Secondly, if things are still like they were in 2017 when I started, first-year registration doesn’t take place until AFTER orientation, and they walk you through the process of how to register with ConnectCarolina and all that at orientation.As for orientation itself, register as soon as you can, for the days that work best for you. It’ll be good peace of mind as you’re getting ready for university life to go ahead and get things done sooner than later.Housing, as a first-year, you have to live on-campus (again, it’s been a few years so someone correct me if I’m wrong). As soon as you’re able, start looking at the available dorms, evaluating roommates if you’re not okay with pure randomness, and lock in a housing contract. Hinton-James tends to be THE first-year dorm of choice/necessity IMO, but I also lived in Morrison for the last three years and loved it for the location and fairly updated amenities/appliances.It’s EXTREMELY important to NOT stress.

stress,/user/poppyseed008/,Mod | Graduate Student,"Hey! I would recommend scheduling an appointment with the UNC career services office. Something that's been helpful for others is taking personality tests like Myers-Briggs and seeing listed careers that are a good fit for your type. Obviously don't take those tests as an absolute promise of what you're going to be fulfilled in, but they can be a good starting point for research into options. I wish I could give you more personal advice, but I'm one of those people that's kind of always known what I want to do. I will say, you honestly don't need to stress too much about it as long as you make sure you're financially independent. I'm not going to tell you to just major in whatever and worry about a career later - you do need something that will give you decent quality of life; however, jobs are just jobs. I've realized in adulthood recently that most people don't see their careers as their ""callings,"" and that is completely okay. It's healthy, actually, because you don't make your job the entire source of your emotional wellbeing. The things that give your life value will often come from your life outside of work.

stress,/user/Wafleo/,Mod | UNC 2024 (Public Health + Pre-Med),"i think there’s a massive mental health crisis going on, especially with younger people affected by the pandemic, and that obviously includes students here at UNC. I would say i’m ~actually~ stressed about 25% of the time during the semester and the other 75% is just the underlying stress of school, extracurriculars, and the general shit we gotta do as humans. I’m affiliated with ARS for ADHD, but I have never used on-campus resources for my mental health. I’ve never struggled with it enough to warrant that, but I can attribute my sanity to having a great support system, understanding professors (some would say it’s rare here, but personally i’ve found that to be mostly untrue except for chem lmao), and having good study habits/routines.I think a big reason why college students are struggling so much with mental health is the disappointment of what they expected college to be: making friends, having the best time of your life, being independent, figuring out their passions etc. Students’ study habits dropped considerably from COVID, and the return to in person learning shocked so many when school got hard again. When neither of those things go to plan, people often feel like they’re failing college socially and academically. Then to top it off, there’s the existential dread of not knowing what they want to do with their lives after college.That being said, UNC isn’t doing enough about it.

It's a nice breather, but don't get me wrong, the stress of finals is very real.Also, because so many departments at UNC require applications for the major, it feels like getting into Carolina isn't enough. You have to prove yourself once again by applying to your major. I feel like with so many clubs here, students join not out of passion but out of hope it looks good on their resume/application.

I have ADHD pretty bad, and while I've met people in high roles with ADHD, typically those people ""have ADHD"".

School in general is touch especially when everyone has different backgrounds and circumstances that very much dictate their education experiences. You're trying to grow up, learn who you are, manage and navigate a world and all these experiences while consistently being under pressure about staying on top of things and making perfect grades. Then so many students are pushed into this standard of ""congrats you graduated high school, now go to college right now, ok you graduated college, now go pick a job that's most likely going to be shitty and not what you expected.""You don't ever get a break and grinding yourself to an oblivion is considered ""normal."" You are giving all you can and that's ok. That doesn't make you stupid or a failure. You are obviously showing that mental health problems are arising and getting diagnosed.Maybe this is a huge sign saying ""you need to stop for a moment.""I didn't go to UNC but when I was in college I was really similar to you.

I ended up just having a severely bad breakdown and I chose to drop out of college.My family absolutely wasn't happy with me but I didn't care. I knew if I kept going it was going to get incredibly bad and I probably wasn't going to be around much longer. It was pretty shitty after I dropped out, ngl. Family pulled complete support and I was homeless till some friends took me in and helped me find some stability with them. It took a little time but probably about a year and a half later, I felt at a point I could go back. So I did. I went back to college and got my degree.I still had to heavily explore my mental health even after that and unfortunately did have two attempts that hospitalized me. But as bad as it went and my life literally falling apart, it got better. I learnt a lot about myself, I learned what my support network was and what I needed, I learned how to set boundaries and come to an understanding with myself. I also started to understand that I wasn't going to ever have the ""normal timeline path"" everyone else around my age was having. I had to take a whole different path but that's ok.

Maybe start considering other schools to apply to, closer to home? Doesn't mean you've made the final decision, but information is good to have.So that's my $.02.

It's the only thing that can truly energize you the right way.

anxiety,/user/kales101/,UNC 2024,"Sorry it posted before I was done lolI always joke that no matter what I’m stressed.For me it’s a combination of depression + anxiety and that I’ve been in college and graduate school for six and a half years now (four for undergrad, two for my first masters, half year for current masters).My senior year of undergrad was when Covid hit and I did my first MA during lockdowns.So I am very experienced with the stress of education, trying to survive on low wages and not get into a shitload of debt, and getting outside experience to buff up my resume.Generally speaking, universities don’t care about student health until it gets noticed and they’re forced to do something about it.Mental health days and thanksgiving break are a joke. The intention is good I suppose but in practice it isn’t helpful. I spend those ‘breaks’ catching up, getting ahead, and/or feeling guilty for not doing anything because I am so tired all the time.For reference, two of my final papers were due on the 30th. And I had two forums due during that week and the following Monday. It is not a restful break when assignments are haunting you and waiting for you the second it’s over.",14 upvotes
anxiety,/user/archaeob/,Grad Student,"I'm going to end up very downvoted for this for not putting all the blame on UNC, but coming from the TA side, the students are so much less prepared after online covid school. I'm TAing classes that didn't change in terms of coursework or workload pre versus post covid but way more students are now unable to handle it. Not blaming the students here, having virtual high school for their last two years or college for the first two years was the issue and students are missing fundamentals through no fault of their own.Instead of having classes with many A-/B+/Bs, a bunch of As and Cs and a handful of Ds and Fs I've been having classes with all As and Ds/Fs. B and C students have basically disappeared. I've seen other TAs and professors elsewhere discussing the same phenomenon, so its not just UNC. Anxiety levels are so much higher than before too, or at least anxiety that is interfering with students being able to turn in work. Everything has gotten worse since 2020, but UNC hasn't gotten harder. Students just lack important skills through no fault of their own and professors here are not equipped to teach things that should have been learned in HS. This is very much a national problem though and not just UNC.",12 upvotes

anxiety,/user/Additional-Bus726/,UNC 2023,"For many of the ""weed out"" classes, the drain on students' mental health is clear. These classes try to squeeze too much material in a short amount of time. These classes usually are massive, making interactions with faculty harder and inaccessible. If students don't pass these weeder classes, this will mess up their entire college life, and possibly jeopardize their life plans. The anxiety definitely drives people insane.Then, there come other problems that further fuels stress, such as registration, financial problems (considering CH is extremely expensive), and so much more.This really boils down to how broken the UNC system is. Just adding peer tutoring, ULA, and sending out meaningless emails seems like a cheap way to ""pretend"" that the administration ""cares"" about its student. The whole structure of the school needs to change in order to make a meaningful change.On a side note, please take care of international students. International students fly to a completely different country with ZERO support. Everyday life is a struggle, and UNC, being this way, makes it impossible for international students to stay mentally sound. Add immigration complexities, life is much more miserable than students that call the US their home.",7 upvotes
anxiety,/user/hugsandhexes/,Resident Library Ghost,"I felt this post in my bones. After two years at UNC and having done psychological withdrawals from 3/4 of my semesters so far, I deeply relate to that hollow feeling of self-disgust and despair, looking around and wondering what’s so wrong with me that I can’t function at the same level that everyone else seems to. Feeling like an outsider with no sense of belonging, in addition to the anxiety of imposter syndrome, made these last two years seem like some of the hardest I’ve ever dealt with, and I can’t count the number of times I’ve almost given up and dropped out. The thing that has helped me the most since I’ve been here has been finding a job that I enjoy, which gives me time to think about something other than classes, and my coworkers have turned into the community that I was missing. Your post reminds me so much of all the ways that I’ve felt since I’ve been at UNC, and if you ever need someone to vent to or to get off campus for a bit (I go to Raleigh and Durham a lot for shows/concerts) feel free to message me.

I regularly travel between Virginia and North Carolina (usually about 2-3 times per week) and it helps me accomplish my goals. Granted, I am an adult with flexible income and no responsibilities - but the point is that it is possible to get around without a car if you are creative and ask for help.Sometimes the best healthcare is to surround yourself with other people.

That ""limit"" doesn't reset, meaning that even though that was in the first year of my MPH, I don't get any additional help in the PhD despite technically graduating then coming back.Beyond that they can* refer you to outside sources. However, those outside services will usually charge, though they will theoretically be familiar with places that take the student BCBS insurance.(*) - I have asked CAPS for referrals for several different reasons (CBT for anxiety in-network on Student Blue in the Triangle, psychoeducational evaluation or medication management in the Charlotte area where UNC-CH has an official research installation) and they have literally never been able to refer me to an appropriate provider.

barriers to mental health,/user/Kelter1313/,UNC 2023,"Tips to set yourself up for post college while you're here :Start interning early (first semester as a freshman)!!! Or applying at least! Obviously opportunities vary by field, but you miss every shot you don't take. An early ""meh"" internship is a gateway to a ""good"" internship the next year and a gateway to your dream job / internship the next year. I recommend the Virtual Student Federal Service for impressive federal internships with a low barrier to entry. It's unpaid, but it's 10 hours max a week, interesting work, and remote so you can easily balance it with school and leverage it to get a better, paid internship later on. They also have work in everything from computer science, to environmental science, Poli sci, business, economics, natural Sciences, language, you name it in agencies ranging from NOAA, State, DOD, Treasury, Transport and more! That can be leveraged to get an interview and as a talking point for interviews into a paid, nicer internship with higher entry difficulty in either public or private sector!Consider getting a job on campus that pays for your housing. Most scholarships (check with yours) let you keep the extra money. RCCs get money for a double room to do basic IT work on campus (on paper, ten hours a week, reality is two if even), while RAs get paid an okay amount above the cost of a single room and get a discount on that room too. The value of this is it lets you save up a decent ""nest egg"" of emergency / grad school money for your early life post college!Look into internship funding when you intern over a summer, UNC has a pool of it and most anyone can go for it!!!Last but not least, have fun in college! This is a time of growth! Volunteer to help or go to conferences, join clubs, make friends with a diverse group of people! Do it all!!! I know my advice here is professional, but even with all this you should maintain a healthy social life. Mental health, physical health, and social health is just as important as professional development!",2 upvotes

social isolation,/user/iamgoosee/,PhD Candidate,"It's never too late! The best thing I've found to do is just say the first hello (to anyone or everyone). As naturally social creatures, we as people are relatively likely to respond well to friendly engagement. With the forced isolation throughout the pandemic, a majority of us have adapted to more reclusive tendencies. Because we don't have as much practice now as we did in the ""before times"" to initiate interactions, it can feel a bit funny at first to get back into the swing of it. But reversing roles, it feels good when friends reach out to us or when people we've yet to meet kindly open up conversation and want to connect.

social isolation,/user/Traditional_Idea/,Former Student,"The combination of Covid health concerns and isolation, excessive academic pressure, Greek-life and other social life FOMO, and persistent pressure from parents, peers, and professors to achieve ""MORE"" is a tinderbox for despair. I'm not casting any stones in one way or another. I am a '96 UNC alum who was involved in Greek life and saw positive and negative from it, and I am a parent of a current junior there who I am constantly trying to de-stress about not ""getting in"" to the ""perfect"" major or grad school, yet he is surrounded by peers telling him that only X major and grad school will net him a ""successful"" life. Anything else is seen as failure. I don't blame the peers; I think it's indicative of the pressure they feel as well, and some of that was present at Carolina in the 90s when I was there, albeit not to this extent. It's just concerning that all of this is layered on top of kids who have experienced an unprecedented disruption in their lives that has left them feeling hopeless about what lies ahead.

social isolation,/user/TyNyeTheTransGuy/,UNC 2025,"Can’t comment on the first part of your question, but im FGLI and it has been tough. My EFC is very low but not zero (I wanna say a little over $500) and I’ve had to take out (federal and unc) loans every semester. Fun fact btw, you can have your work-study amount converted into a loan (my plan was to do this then get a higher paying off campus job and basically pay it off super early, which is a legit strategy to go ahead and pay off tuition before they put a hold on your account, but things got stressful and job searching is tiring). Even with loans, I’ve needed to supplement with a chunk of savings and a $500 loan from my partner’s family.My partner’s family is very much not low income and has been a saving grace. Frankly, I would not have more than one coat or wearable shoes or be able to eat at restaurants if not for them. If you don’t have family supporting you (my case), it will be difficult, but I think that’s true of anywhere. It’s isolating in itself, but it would be worse if I had more than a couple friends because I just can’t afford to go out to restaurants and expensive activities to socialize like everyone wants to do. Again, that’s probably an everywhere thing.Edit: also, advice that worked for my but might not be your thing. Waiting tables at a high-ish traffic restaurant is EXHAUSTING, and the base pay is routinely gonna be garbage, but tips can be pretty good especially if you’re working dinner shifts or weekends (probably depends on kind of restaurant too).

Hence, not only did the university fail to keep the virus resonably under control, but also made really no effort to balance exposure risk with mental health concerns and student isolation.If UNC had tested everyone and had a staggered opening there would have been much more room for in-person social programming, even if it would’ve been limited.

There are jokes in people that age able how people who lived on North campus are weird and loners.  Back then, only a small subset of freshman lived on North so they were very isolated from south and a lot of people simply didn't have any friends who lived up there.  That being said, since then UNC has doubled the amount of freshman dorms on North, and COVID rules limited the benefits of south (social).  I'd imagine south campus will return to south campus vibes at some point and maybe that will be the social preference in the fall, but it's hard to say.With that in mind, north campus is preferable to south by every metric except socially and maybe hall vs suite style (though that's really a personal preference).  It's way closer to everything, the rooms are way bigger, and you'll never have to wait for a shower or toilet.Where ever you end up, just be sure to take initiative to meet new people where you live, join a couple clubs, go to some parties, and you'll have more friends then you know what to do with.",9 upvotes
social isolation,/user/sailor_rini/,Alum,"Okay, now that I'm awake, I wanted to address this comment specifically (and I initially had this reaction to the title as well, until I read). I see your point, but quite frankly, this is part of the problem, and seems to deny the concept of virtue-signalling altogether which is what I believe OP is getting at.  I do see your point in that sometimes accusations of ""virtue signalling"" can be unfair, and often are virtue signals in and of themselves. And I've called someone out before for precisely that, as it came across as a belief that only ""they"" are the moral ones and everyone else is a ""virtue signaller"", which is arrogance. However, in this context, this is not the vibe I was getting and I felt that this point was actually more profound than that in the context of mental health.Moreover, for this part:No one thinks you “owe” them anything, they’re trying to make a difference in any small way and TBH this is a very self-centered post.This is the problem in and of itself.  This comes across a bit as asking for an ""ideal victim""/respectability politics. Yes, it may be ""self-centered"". But....to be frank, a lot of mental health ins ""unsexy""----there are self-centered aspects to anxiety, depression, etc. It affects your relationships with others. It isolates you from people. You snap. You get irritable. You take stuff out on others when you don't mean to, you can be distrustful, and so on. This is kind of the point, of you know, why it's an illness that needs treatment. Moreover, it can feel more isolating for some people when they're being nice when you're a stranger/number, but then they won't talk to you in class at all and act rude.Let me give a concrete example (with racism instead of mental health):There was this horrible girl on my floor, my first year here who always kept virtue signalling about how not ""racist"" she is, how she's ""basically black because she's poor"", and so on. She would call people out all the time. But....she also wouldn't talk to me, and she also bullied and belittled me the entire time there. Later, I made another friend who revealed to me that she knew this girl----and this girl literally called them the n word one time and called them ""ugly and black"".Actually, when I was physically ill and had to move out, this girl kept trying to ""check in"" on me but in actuality she was gossipping. I knew better from her behavior with other people, not to say anything directly to her.When you see stuff like this, you get jaded. This applies to basically anything social-justice related (racism, sexism, mental health, whatever you could possibly think of)---some people use it as an opportunity to post platitudes but it just....doesn't match in their daily life.Yes, it is uncharitable to others because honestly, probably a plurality of the people posting notes and doing whatever they can ARE being genuine----but their hands are tied, and it's hard to reach out directly. Maybe some of the people posting are putting their energy out there in hopes someone will reciprocate as well. There are entire shades of grey between black and white ""OP's post is selfish"", ""these people are fake"", etc. Two things can be true at once, and I think that your approach in this comment here was a bit uncharitable in and of itself, as they expressed specifically why it bothers them and the loneliness they're feeling.What this post is about is touching on a wider culture problem, with the ""wall"" that u/sweetypantz mentioned that's part of the culture here, and more specifically, part of the modern culture. As I mentioned previously as well, it's jarring as there is an incongruency between these messages and then daily life where kids are quite competitive and standoffish towards each other.  If you are young, this can make you cynical. I see it differently myself just by life experience and the fact that I'm not *that* young, and I'm not a first year coming up against this for the first time. But some people are, and for them, it will feel like they're screaming into the void.The problem, in my opinion, is the ideology and culture *itself* behind the mental health epidemic here to begin with. We are atomized and put into a hierarchal/competitive environment, and the approach to mental health has been an individualistic approach which I think is incorrect---ie, ""YOU are ill, YOU need to do this, YOU need to breathe, YOU need to take care"". And I think it's wrong, because it would be one thing if just a couple of people were ill----but when the whole community has such a high rate of mental health issues? No way it's just an individual thing, it's a symptom of a bigger problem that affects waaay more people.I often see calls for ""self-care""----what we also need is community care, we need collaboration, we need to be told it's okay to not be okay, and we need to break away from toxic positivity and towards a more balanced view of a real human emotional life. It feels like students get treated like robots with on and off buttons. And I think this was the most profound point that OP was getting at, specifically here:“Everything sad is going to come untrue,” oh okay—thanks. It just makes me feel more stressed, “don’t give up,” just feels like another responsibility stacked upon the others.I've felt this myself, not only with mental health issues, but physical health issues. I finally got diagnosed with a heart related issue (POTS) and they found a blood related issue as well, and this was after an ER visit. But before, the responsibility was unfairly put on me and I was told to do ""breathing exercises"", ""meditation"" whenever I would have fainting spells and very high heart rates (sometimes reaching 200) because it was concluded before looking at all my symptoms (hypotension), that my high heart rate was due to ""anxiety"". I had to withdraw so many things and I'll graduate at a later age than my peers because of how many disruptions I've had chasing down the wrong problem because people wouldn't diagnose me correctly, and then proceeded to put the onus solely on me to fix my heart rate with ""breathing"" (that actually made it worse). No one until recently really bothered to look (and it was because of the work of my sweet father that I was able to get any help). This was horrendously frustrating and I felt super useless when I kept trying those breathing, yoga, meditation exercises and it just made it worse.If this can happen with a physical issue, imagine what happens with a mental health issue. Especially if you already feel useless and then people treat you like you're non-compliant when you're doing the best you can.",11 upvotes

In the short time I've been here, I've seen this same type of loneliness post several times & it seems like it's everywhere.I'm sorry to hear it - not a student, but I've been there, including in college - lifelong loner & never did a great job of meeting people. in college my only friends were in my program (Architecture, which is a pretty time-intensive cohort driven program, so always with essentially the same people for 5 years). since then (I'm turning 50), I'm a lifelong loner. any friends I have are superficial. That has bothered me at times in life, but I'm seriously ok with it now.here are my recs I shared with the other posts I've seen in case any help:get out of your room. find something to involve yourself in - a group/club, activity, purpose, etc.- build some healthy habits in various areas such asexercise, walking, running, hiking, working out, dance, yoga - something to stress your body and release endorphins, etc. yet get you around others with similar interestscreativity - sketching, painting, drawing, magic, cooking - find an outlet for your energies that challenges you and rewards you and that you can develop & grow over time (since the start of covid, mine has been cooking, which has been very rewarding & is easier to learn than ever before b/c of great YT channels) yet get you around others with similar interestsproductivity/contribution - get a job or volunteer - one of the easiest ways to make a connection is to be thrown into a group of random people engaged in working to accomplish the same job/task/goal and accomplishing such can give a sense of fulfillment that you may be lacking.when seeking out groups, IMO, smaller groups are better than larger, quieter events are better than louder (especially bars - hard to converse/make a connection in a loud space/event).It definitely takes effort to make & maintain friendships. a business networking book ""never eat alone"" comes to mind - it's about networking which can be pretty superficial but could be applied to friendships (and we have to eat, so multi-task ;)meditation/mindfulness (especially, as that's something I'm working on) is something I would recommend considering - not necessarily as group activity or to make friends (though there are meditation groups) but I'm recommending it b/c it is training your mind & is helping me. (if you are religious, then lean into that for sure, but IMO, meditation/mindfulness is different than prayer and is not in conflict with religion as some might think. If we are created in God's image, then wouldn't God want us training/disciplining our mind like our body & our heart?)if loneliness is really bad, reach out for some counseling - mental health is critical & colleges have resources to help. I'm a fan of counseling.College is a great opportunity for you to explore and learn about yourself - do you like working with your hands or mind or both, do you like to make long-term deep dives into a few questions or have quick constantly changing work/problems. I hope you'll take advantage of the opportunity, forget about ""friends"" & ""loneliness"" & lean into finding & taking advantage of the opportunities 4 years of college affords and find/act on your passion. I think if you do, you'll either find friends/end loneliness, or at least find that lack of friends/being a loner is ok - mental health & healthy habits & true joy are still achievable.addressing your case in particular, it will be harder for a part time student. if you're only on campus on Tuesdays & Thursdays, look to see what DOES happen on those days that interests you.  are there any book clubs getting together, any fitness classes at the school gym. find every activity list you can and figure out a way to participate in something that happens regularly on Tuesday/Thursday outside your class schedule that also either interests you or you'd be willing to try.",24 upvotes

If you are young, this can make you cynical. I see it differently myself just by life experience and the fact that I'm not *that* young, and I'm not a first year coming up against this for the first time. But some people are, and for them, it will feel like they're screaming into the void.The problem, in my opinion, is the ideology and culture *itself* behind the mental health epidemic here to begin with. We are atomized and put into a hierarchal/competitive environment, and the approach to mental health has been an individualistic approach which I think is incorrect---ie, ""YOU are ill, YOU need to do this, YOU need to breathe, YOU need to take care"". And I think it's wrong, because it would be one thing if just a couple of people were ill----but when the whole community has such a high rate of mental health issues? No way it's just an individual thing, it's a symptom of a bigger problem that affects waaay more people.I often see calls for ""self-care""----what we also need is community care, we need collaboration, we need to be told it's okay to not be okay, and we need to break away from toxic positivity and towards a more balanced view of a real human emotional life. It feels like students get treated like robots with on and off buttons. And I think this was the most profound point that OP was getting at, specifically here:“Everything sad is going to come untrue,” oh okay—thanks. It just makes me feel more stressed, “don’t give up,” just feels like another responsibility stacked upon the others.I've felt this myself, not only with mental health issues, but physical health issues. I finally got diagnosed with a heart related issue (POTS) and they found a blood related issue as well, and this was after an ER visit. But before, the responsibility was unfairly put on me and I was told to do ""breathing exercises"", ""meditation"" whenever I would have fainting spells and very high heart rates (sometimes reaching 200) because it was concluded before looking at all my symptoms (hypotension), that my high heart rate was due to ""anxiety"". I had to withdraw so many things and I'll graduate at a later age than my peers because of how many disruptions I've had chasing down the wrong problem because people wouldn't diagnose me correctly, and then proceeded to put the onus solely on me to fix my heart rate with ""breathing"" (that actually made it worse). No one until recently really bothered to look (and it was because of the work of my sweet father that I was able to get any help). This was horrendously frustrating and I felt super useless when I kept trying those breathing, yoga, meditation exercises and it just made it worse.If this can happen with a physical issue, imagine what happens with a mental health issue. Especially if you already feel useless and then people treat you like you're non-compliant when you're doing the best you can.",11 upvotes

loneliness,/user/poppyseed008/,Mod | Graduate Student,"I had all online classes this semester and chose to stay home for this reason, but I changed my mind and moved to campus halfway through lol. If you’re prone to loneliness or procrastination especially when you’re sad, you might end up in the same position I was, which was that I couldn’t get any work done without at least being in the same town as the people I love. Money-wise, it’s a better choice to stay home. Mental-health-wise, it really just depends on you.",4 upvotes

hopelessness,/user/goheels104/,UNC 2021,"UNC basically requires you to get a neuropsych evaluation for campus health to give you meds for ADHD. That’s potentially expensive and annoying to deal with, and it might take a while to get it done.My advice is to go to your gp with a really solid explanation of why you believe you have ADHD and ask to be put on medication. Then have them send your prescriptions to Walgreens or whatever pharmacy is closest.Medication won’t “cure” your ADHD, you still have to put in a lot of additional effort to manage it. But the meds will make doing so significantly easier. For that reason, I’d also suggest trying to find a therapist who specializes in CBT for ADHD (or just CBT in general).Don’t go through campus health, they (understandably) have lots of barriers for getting medicated. However, the school does have lots of good resources for people with ADHD. ARS will be limited by not having a neuropsych eval, but there are lots of other ones available through CAPS or the Learning Center (I’d suggest academic coaching).There are also peer groups for ADHD through UNC but I forget how to find those (probably CAPS). If you need community support, I’d suggest those and to stay away from online ADHD communities. IMO places like the ADHD related subreddits are terrible for having bad advice/info and for perpetuating a sense of hopelessness. Great for commiserating but terrible for self-improvement.You’re doing the right thing by thinking about this early! It can be difficult getting help for ADHD, but don’t get discouraged! Good luck!",7 upvotes

hopelessness,/user/Traditional_Idea/,Former Student,"The combination of Covid health concerns and isolation, excessive academic pressure, Greek-life and other social life FOMO, and persistent pressure from parents, peers, and professors to achieve ""MORE"" is a tinderbox for despair. I'm not casting any stones in one way or another. I am a '96 UNC alum who was involved in Greek life and saw positive and negative from it, and I am a parent of a current junior there who I am constantly trying to de-stress about not ""getting in"" to the ""perfect"" major or grad school, yet he is surrounded by peers telling him that only X major and grad school will net him a ""successful"" life. Anything else is seen as failure. I don't blame the peers; I think it's indicative of the pressure they feel as well, and some of that was present at Carolina in the 90s when I was there, albeit not to this extent. It's just concerning that all of this is layered on top of kids who have experienced an unprecedented disruption in their lives that has left them feeling hopeless about what lies ahead. We all have to be carefully honed in on this as it seems suicide (attempts are just as awful as they represent the same danger) is also now a public health threat at UNC.Edited for typos - sorry, still on first morning coffee",81 upvotes
hopelessness,/user/bruhchair/,ROML Listserv Survivor,"as a chem (bs - biochem) major it certainly has been hard, but don't be discouraged! it is doable and it is not hopeless. remember not to overwork yourself and to have a balanced class schedule. that is one thing i really messed up on last fall and will never make the mistake again. if you genuinely have an interest in chem, the classes will be really interesting and even fun. yes, you need to deal with seemingly unfair classes (im thinking about labs here. soooo much work for only 1 credit hour) and condescending faculty, but it is not bad enough to give up on the major, and i'm sure every major has their fair share of bad things. ive heard the upper level classes that are much smaller, only for chem majors, and taught by research professors are a world different from the lower level classes (gen chem, orgo) that /everyone/ who is pre health needs to take. do not short yourself from the opportunity especially since you haven't taken any chem classes yet. even though i agree with some of the hate on the chem department, it hasn't been as awful as some people make it out to be. unc has a renowned and top-class chem department, and you should take advantage of it if that is what you are interested in. feel free to pm me if you have specific questions, and do not be discouraged - give it a shot first!",1 upvote

hopelessness,/user/cyanide890/,UNC 2025,"you're not just a cautionary tale. years later you might feel somewhat bothered by this regret, but probably only when you get into the mood for being especially somber about the past. mostly life moves on, feelings and situations change, bet that you'll have a lot of things to be occupied with and do better on. plus it isn't over yet, you'll sit through this next semester, walk through the classes, the scenery, the dining halls, the campus - there's time to consider things and do what you can.I spent my first months here moping around, failing my courses, and generally feeling worthless and inferior. mostly I felt like I was wasted potential, blaming myself for not doing all that I could have - I just didn't know anything, and let all that time slip away while hiding in my shell. I should have just said screw it, did the random things I was contemplating. if it didn't matter, then at least it was interesting in the moment. and I've dealt with humiliation and abuse, what's a little bit more if I was depressed anyway.honestly I'll probably spend next semester alone too, even though I've joined some clubs and go to events and make it a point to talk to people. but, okay sorry this is the actual important part, I've felt considerably better this november, despite how I always just wanted to die already. maybe I was just afraid of death and losing things so I did this to myself... anyway, I just made it a goal to do little things this month, may not have expected too much of myself and just explored interesting things. perhaps it only felt better because I had more hope and less stressors, was able to fool myself into believing that I could still do things, reclaim that potential. had thoughts like, if you want something, might as well accept that you have to rely on your own willpower to get it, stop waiting for that tenuous salvation or for someone else to save you.a semester is a few months. if you ask a few people what the most exciting part of their life was, maybe someone will say that it happened within that timespan - not telling you to expect too much, just saying that there's time to still try even if it seems hopeless or too late. may just the memory of doing so will seem significant. you'll probably remember this last semester more than any other later on, and if you already ""failed"" then it seems you have less to lose in some regard. that being said, you could still just go with the flow since who even knows what happens. it just does, might as well accept and adapt if you can't change it. imo mental turmoil can be hard, with trying to balance different values like hope, moderation, despair, integrity, idk. things will probably just seem like a dice roll, as most fortunate things do - may not be able to change the outcome, but you can modify the die to be in your favor, you can keep rolling it because what else is there.so yeah... sorry for sticking a random, unorganized, probably entitled rant onto here. will probably delete later, dm for plotting this life bettering thing though I prob just ignore most things",8 upvotes
